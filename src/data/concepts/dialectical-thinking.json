    "summary": "Thinking through dialogue and the synthesis of opposing ideas to reach deeper understanding.",
    "explanation": "Dialectical thinking is a method of reasoning through the juxtaposition and synthesis of opposing ideas. Rooted in the work of Hegel and adapted by thinkers like Marx, it follows a pattern of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis - an idea is proposed, challenged by its opposite, and a higher understanding emerges that incorporates truth from both. Dialectical thinking embraces contradiction as generative rather than simply resolving it. In knowledge management, dialectical thinking manifests as deliberately seeking opposing viewpoints, steel-manning arguments before critiquing them, and synthesizing diverse perspectives into more nuanced understanding. It guards against one-sided thinking and promotes intellectual honesty. Writing notes that explore multiple sides of issues exercises dialectical thinking.",
