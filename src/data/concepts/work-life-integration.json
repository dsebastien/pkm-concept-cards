    "name": "Work-Life Integration",
    "summary": "An approach where life takes priority and work is adjusted to fit around personal goals, not the reverse.",
    "explanation": "Work-life integration is an approach where work is not considered the be-all and end-all of life, but rather a utility. Instead of trying to find perfect work-life balance (implying equal weight), the idea is to put life right in the center and adjust work based on life goals. This inverts the traditional relationship where people fit their lives around work demands. Work-life integration asks: What kind of life do I want to live? Then: How can work support that life? This might mean choosing flexible work arrangements, setting firm boundaries, or redesigning your career entirely. It connects closely with Zen Productivity and the recognition that sustainable high performance comes from alignment between work and personal values, not from sacrificing one for the other.",
