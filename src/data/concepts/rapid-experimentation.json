    "summary": "Running quick, low-cost experiments to test ideas and learn before major investments.",
    "explanation": "Rapid experimentation is the practice of testing ideas through quick, low-cost experiments rather than extensive planning and analysis. The approach: form hypotheses, design minimal tests, run experiments quickly, measure results, and iterate. This replaces: long planning cycles, extensive research, and big bets based on assumptions. Rapid experimentation is central to: lean startup methodology, growth hacking, and scientific management. Key principles include: test the riskiest assumptions first, make experiments as small as possible, define success criteria upfront, and be willing to kill ideas quickly. The goal is learning speed - the faster you can run experiments, the faster you learn what works. Challenges include: ensuring experiments actually test the hypothesis, avoiding experimenting on everything instead of deciding, and building organizational tolerance for failed experiments. For knowledge workers, rapid experimentation means: testing before committing, treating beliefs as hypotheses, and valuing learning over being right.",
