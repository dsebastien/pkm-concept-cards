    "summary": "A negotiation approach where all parties achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.",
    "explanation": "The Win-Win Method is a negotiation and conflict resolution approach that seeks outcomes where all parties involved benefit. Rather than viewing negotiation as a zero-sum game where one party's gain is another's loss, this method focuses on expanding the pie so everyone can walk away satisfied.\n\nCore Principles:\n\n1. Focus on Interests, Not Positions: Instead of arguing over fixed positions, explore the underlying interests and needs of all parties. Often, creative solutions can satisfy everyone's core concerns.\n\n2. Separate People from Problems: Address issues without attacking individuals. Maintain respectful relationships while solving substantive conflicts.\n\n3. Generate Options for Mutual Gain: Brainstorm multiple solutions before deciding. Look for creative alternatives that might satisfy all parties better than the obvious compromises.\n\n4. Use Objective Criteria: Base agreements on fair standards, precedents, or principles rather than pressure or arbitrary decisions.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Creates sustainable agreements (parties are more likely to honor deals they're happy with)\n- Preserves and strengthens relationships\n- Leads to more creative solutions\n- Reduces resentment and future conflicts\n- Builds trust and opens doors for future collaboration\n\nApplications:\n\n- Business negotiations and contracts\n- Workplace conflict resolution\n- Family and personal relationships\n- International diplomacy\n- Customer service situations\n\nThe approach was popularized by Roger Fisher and William Ury in their influential book 'Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In.'",
