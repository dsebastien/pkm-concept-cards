    "explanation": "LifeOS (Life Operating System) is a concept of using your PKM system as a comprehensive command center for managing all aspects of life - goals, projects, plans, tasks, priorities, health, relationships, finances, and more. It combines strategic (long-term vision) and tactical (daily actions) perspectives. A LifeOS provides focus, tracking, and accountability. It's about seeing your knowledge base not just as an archive but as an active tool for living intentionally and achieving your goals.",
