    "summary": "The ability to manage and regulate emotional responses to situations.",
    "explanation": "Emotional control is the ability to manage and regulate emotional responses - not suppressing emotions, but choosing how to respond to them. It's a core component of emotional intelligence. Components include: awareness (recognizing emotions as they arise), acceptance (acknowledging emotions without judgment), regulation (modulating emotional intensity), and expression (choosing how to respond). Techniques for emotional control: pause before reacting (create space between stimulus and response), cognitive reappraisal (reframe how you interpret situations), breathing techniques (physiological regulation), and perspective-taking (consider other viewpoints). Emotional control is not: suppression (ignoring emotions - harmful long-term), being emotionless (emotions provide valuable information), or never expressing feelings (appropriate expression is healthy). Benefits include: better decision-making (emotions don't hijack thinking), improved relationships (responding rather than reacting), reduced stress (not amplifying emotional experiences), and greater resilience (recovering from setbacks). Developing emotional control: practice mindfulness (notice emotions without acting), build emotional vocabulary (name emotions specifically), and reflect on triggers (understand what activates you). For knowledge workers, emotional control enables: professional conduct under pressure, difficult conversations, and sustained performance despite challenges.",
