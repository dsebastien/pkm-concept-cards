    "explanation": "Habit Stacking, popularized by James Clear in Atomic Habits, is the practice of linking a new habit to an existing one to leverage established neural pathways and create natural triggers. The formula is: 'After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].' By attaching new behaviors to existing routines, you reduce the friction of habit formation. This technique is particularly useful for integrating PKM practices into daily life.",
