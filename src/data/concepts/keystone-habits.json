    "summary": "Habits that trigger a cascade of positive changes across multiple areas of life when established.",
    "explanation": "Keystone Habits, a concept popularized by Charles Duhigg in 'The Power of Habit,' are habits that have a disproportionate impact on other behaviors and areas of your life. Like a keystone in an arch that holds all the other stones in place, these habits create a ripple effect that triggers positive changes across multiple domains. Exercise is a classic keystone habit: people who start exercising regularly often find themselves eating better, sleeping more, being more productive at work, and feeling less stressed - even though they only intentionally changed their exercise behavior. Other common keystone habits include: making your bed each morning (creates a sense of accomplishment), family dinners (improves communication and children's academic performance), keeping a food journal (doubles weight loss effectiveness), and meditation (improves emotional regulation across situations). The power of keystone habits lies in their ability to create small wins that build momentum, establish structures that other habits can piggyback on, and shift identity in ways that make other positive changes feel natural. When building habits, focusing on keystone habits first provides maximum leverage for personal transformation.",
