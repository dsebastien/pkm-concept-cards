    "summary": "Optimizing content to be selected as direct answers by search engines and voice assistants.",
    "explanation": "Answer Engine Optimization focuses on winning direct answers in search—featured snippets, knowledge panels, voice assistant responses, and AI-generated answers. Unlike traditional SEO (ranking links), AEO aims to provide THE answer. Key strategies include: targeting question-based queries, providing clear, concise answers (40-60 words), using structured formatting (lists, tables, headers), implementing schema markup, and optimizing for natural language (how people ask questions). Voice search makes AEO increasingly important—when someone asks Alexa or Siri a question, there's only one answer given. For creators, AEO means structuring content to directly answer questions your audience asks, making it easy for search engines to extract and display your expertise.",
