    "summary": "The psychological principle that limited availability increases perceived value.",
    "explanation": "Scarcity is the principle that things become more desirable when they're in limited supply. This cognitive bias influences behavior in many contexts - from marketing (limited-time offers) to productivity (deadline pressure). In PKM, understanding scarcity helps recognize when it's being used to manipulate (FOMO-inducing newsletters) and when it's genuinely useful (using deadlines to create focus). Time is genuinely scarce, making it essential to be intentional about how it's spent.",
