    "summary": "The cumulative cost of inadequate sleep that must eventually be repaid.",
    "explanation": "Sleep debt is the accumulated deficit from not getting enough sleep. It's very taxing - when the sleep debt collectors come, you always have to pay dearly. Each hour of sleep you steal costs you way more in return through reduced cognitive function, impaired decision-making, and decreased productivity. You're doing yourself a disservice whenever you don't respect your body and mind. Both need rest to function properly. Recharging is not an option, it's a basic human need. Spending hours awake but in a lingering, unproductive state is of no use. Better to rest properly and return refreshed.",
