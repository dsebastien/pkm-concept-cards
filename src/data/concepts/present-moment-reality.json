    "summary": "The only thing that truly exists is the present - the past is memory, the future is imagination, and both rob us of experiencing now.",
    "explanation": "The present moment is the only thing that is real. This philosophical insight has profound implications for how we live:\n\n**The past doesn't exist:**\nWe can have regrets about the past, but what's done is done. There's no way back, no time machine, no reset button. The past exists only as memory.\n\n**The future doesn't exist:**\nWe can worry about the future endlessly, but until it unfolds, it simply doesn't exist yet. The future exists only as imagination and projection.\n\n**Only the present is real:**\nAll that we can actually experience is the current moment. And we better live in it, because the present keeps passing by, continuously becoming our past.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\n- Depression often comes from living in the past\n- Anxiety often comes from living in the future\n- Peace comes from living in the present\n\n**The paradox of catching 'now':**\n\nThe present is impossible to catch. The moment we think about 'now,' it has already become the past. That's why we need to focus on *living* the moment rather than *thinking about* it. When we think about it, we fail to experience it fully.\n\n**Practical application:**\n\n- Stop projecting yourself into an imagined better future\n- Release regrets about an unchangeable past\n- Focus attention on what's happening right now\n- Practice gratitude for what exists in this moment",
