    "summary": "Reframing failure as information about what doesn't work rather than personal inadequacy.",
    "explanation": "Failure as feedback is a reframe that treats failures as information about what doesn't work rather than evidence of personal inadequacy or reason for shame. This perspective views each failure as: data about approach effectiveness, clarification of constraints and requirements, and direction toward better methods. Thomas Edison famously embodied this: 'I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.' The reframe is powerful because: it separates identity from outcome, enables analytical response, and maintains motivation through setbacks. The perspective requires: genuine curiosity about what went wrong, willingness to adjust based on feedback, and emotional resilience to process failure as information. The reframe doesn't deny failure's emotional impact but changes the cognitive response. It's particularly valuable in: experimentation contexts, skill development, and innovative work where failure is inevitable. For knowledge workers, adopting failure-as-feedback means: asking 'what did I learn?' after every setback, adjusting approaches based on failure data, and maintaining experimental mindset where failure is expected and valuable.",
