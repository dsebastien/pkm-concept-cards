    "explanation": "A Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG) is a network-based representation of an individual's knowledge, showing concepts as nodes and their relationships as edges. Unlike traditional note-taking, a PKG emphasizes connections and enables discovery through traversal. Modern tools like Obsidian visualize your PKG, revealing clusters of related ideas, orphan notes needing connections, and unexpected relationships. Building a PKG transforms passive note collection into an active thinking tool that grows smarter over time.",
