    "summary": "A graph with directed edges and no cycles, useful for representing dependencies and hierarchies.",
    "explanation": "A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a data structure with nodes connected by directed edges, where no path returns to itself (no cycles). DAGs are fundamental in task scheduling, version control, and knowledge organization. In PKM, understanding DAGs helps design note structures that avoid circular dependencies while maintaining clear information flow. Project tasks, concept hierarchies, and prerequisite chains naturally form DAGs, enabling clear ordering and dependency management.",
