    "explanation": "A Capture System is a reliable external storage for collecting thoughts, ideas, and information before they're forgotten. The brain is for having ideas, not holding them - so a trusted capture system is essential. Key requirements: always available (capture tool on you at all times), low friction (quick to use), trusted (you know items will be processed). Your capture system might be a physical notebook, a notes app, or voice memos. Daily notes often serve as the central capture hub in PKM systems.",
