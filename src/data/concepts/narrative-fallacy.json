    "summary": "The tendency to create overly coherent stories from random or complex events.",
    "explanation": "The Narrative Fallacy is the human tendency to construct coherent stories and explanations from random or complex events, making the world seem more predictable and understandable than it really is. We see patterns where none exist and create causal explanations for coincidences. This bias can lead to overconfidence in predictions and simplified understanding of complex systems. Awareness of this fallacy helps maintain intellectual humility in note-taking and analysis.",
