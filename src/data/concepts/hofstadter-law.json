    "summary": "Things always take longer than expected, even accounting for the law itself.",
    "explanation": "Hofstadter's Law states: 'It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.' This self-referential adage captures the persistent tendency to underestimate task duration despite knowing about underestimation. Related to the planning fallacy, it's a humbling reminder to add generous buffers to estimates. For PKM projects like building a system, expect it to take longer than planned and design for incremental progress rather than complete transformation.",
