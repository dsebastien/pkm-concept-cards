    "explanation": "Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell that fire both when we perform an action and when we observe someone else performing that same action. Discovered in the 1990s, they're believed to play a key role in learning through imitation, understanding others' intentions, and empathy. When you watch someone smile, your mirror neurons for smiling activate, helping you understand their emotional state. This neural mirroring may underlie our capacity for social learning, language acquisition, and emotional contagion. Mirror neurons explain why observing experts can improve our own skills, why emotions are contagious in groups, and why we yawn when others yawn. Understanding mirror neurons has implications for learning strategies, leadership, and creating positive team environments.",
