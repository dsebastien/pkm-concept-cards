    "summary": "The brain's emotional processing center, responsible for detecting threats and triggering fear responses.",
    "explanation": "The amygdala is an almond-shaped structure deep within the brain's temporal lobe, serving as the brain's alarm system and emotional processing center. It rapidly evaluates incoming sensory information for potential threats and triggers the fight-or-flight response when danger is detected. The amygdala processes emotions, especially fear and anxiety, and plays a crucial role in emotional memory formation. It can hijack rational thinking during stress, explaining why we sometimes react emotionally before thinking. This 'amygdala hijack' was adaptive for survival but can be problematic in modern life. Understanding the amygdala helps explain anxiety disorders, emotional reactivity, and why practices like mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal can help regulate emotional responses.",
