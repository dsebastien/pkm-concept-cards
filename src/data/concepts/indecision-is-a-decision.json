    "summary": "Recognizing that not deciding is itself a choice with real consequences.",
    "explanation": "Indecision is a decision reminds us that when we hesitate or avoid making a choice, we are still making a choice - the choice to remain in an intermediate state. This connects to analysis paralysis, where overthinking prevents action. The crucial insight is that we always decide, even when we think we're not deciding. When we don't choose, we simply choose to create an intermediary situation that may or may not be positive. Like any decision, indecision has consequences - sometimes positive but often negative, especially as the hesitation extends. Generally, the longer the indecision and analysis paralysis, the more taxing and negative the situation becomes. Recognizing indecision as a decision helps break the illusion that avoiding choice protects us from consequences.",
