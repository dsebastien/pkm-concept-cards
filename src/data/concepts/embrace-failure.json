    "summary": "The practice of welcoming failure as a necessary and valuable part of growth and achievement.",
    "explanation": "Embracing failure is the practice of welcoming failure as a necessary and valuable part of growth, learning, and achievement rather than something to be avoided at all costs. The embrace involves: expecting failure as part of any ambitious pursuit, reducing fear and shame around failure, and actively using failures as stepping stones. This differs from: seeking failure (failure for its own sake), ignoring failure (not learning from setbacks), and accepting failure passively (giving up after failing). Embracing failure requires: redefining success to include productive failure, building emotional resilience, and creating systems that extract value from failures. The practice enables: bolder action, faster learning, and greater achievement than failure-avoidance strategies. Critics note that uncritical failure-embracing can lead to: insufficient prevention, learned carelessness, and failure normalization. Healthy embrace involves: distinguishing failure types, maximizing learning, and maintaining high standards while accepting inevitable setbacks. For knowledge workers, embracing failure means: taking appropriate risks, treating failures as learning opportunities, and maintaining momentum despite setbacks.",
