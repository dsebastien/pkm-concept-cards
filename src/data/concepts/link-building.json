    "summary": "The process of acquiring hyperlinks from other websites to improve search engine rankings.",
    "explanation": "Link building earns backlinks—links from other sites to yours—which search engines interpret as votes of confidence. Quality matters more than quantity: one link from a respected, relevant site is worth more than hundreds from low-quality sites. White-hat strategies include: creating linkable content (original research, tools, comprehensive guides), guest posting on relevant sites, broken link building (finding broken links and offering your content as replacement), digital PR (newsworthy stories), and relationship-based outreach. Black-hat tactics (buying links, link farms) risk penalties. For creators, link building often happens naturally through quality content, but can be accelerated by: creating shareable resources, contributing to industry publications, and building genuine relationships with other creators who link to useful resources.",
