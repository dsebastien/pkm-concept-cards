    "summary": "The extent to which consumers recognize and recall a brand and its products.",
    "explanation": "Brand awareness exists on a spectrum: from unaware, to recognition (recognizing when seen), to recall (remembering unprompted), to top-of-mind (first brand thought of in a category). High awareness provides competitive advantage—familiar brands feel less risky and are chosen more often. Building awareness requires consistent presence across touchpoints: content, advertising, PR, events, partnerships, and word-of-mouth. Measurement includes aided and unaided recall surveys, search volume, social mentions, and share of voice. For creators and knowledge workers, brand awareness means being known in your niche—when someone thinks 'productivity expert' or 'PKM teacher,' does your name come up? Awareness precedes trust, which precedes purchase.",
