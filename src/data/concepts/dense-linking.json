    "summary": "The practice of creating many links between notes to maximize connectivity and discoverability.",
    "explanation": "Dense linking is the practice of creating abundant links between notes to maximize connectivity in a knowledge network. Rather than linking sparingly only when connections are obvious, dense linking encourages linking generously whenever a meaningful relationship exists. This increases the surface area for discovering related ideas, makes individual notes more accessible through multiple paths, and creates a richer web of associations. The philosophy holds that it's better to over-link than under-link, as unused links have little cost while missed connections represent lost value. Critics note that too many links can create noise; practitioners balance density with meaningful connections. Dense linking works best with atomic notes where each note has a clear, linkable concept.",
