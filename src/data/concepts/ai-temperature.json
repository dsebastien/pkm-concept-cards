    "explanation": "Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness and creativity of AI language model outputs. It affects how the model selects from possible next tokens (words). Low temperature (0-0.3): model strongly favors most likely tokens, producing more deterministic, focused, and repetitive outputs. Best for: factual queries, coding, analysis, and tasks requiring consistency. High temperature (0.7-1.0+): model gives more consideration to less likely tokens, producing more diverse, creative, and sometimes surprising outputs. Best for: creative writing, brainstorming, generating alternatives, and exploratory tasks. How it works technically: temperature scales the probability distribution before sampling - low temperature sharpens it (top choices dominate), high temperature flattens it (more choices considered). Practical guidance: start with default (often 0.7-1.0), lower for precision tasks, raise for creativity, and experiment to find optimal settings for your use case. Temperature interacts with other parameters like top-p (nucleus sampling). For knowledge workers, understanding temperature helps: get more consistent results when needed, generate more creative options when exploring, and tune AI behavior to match task requirements.",
