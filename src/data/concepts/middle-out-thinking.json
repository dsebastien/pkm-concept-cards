    "summary": "A thinking approach that combines top-down and bottom-up reasoning starting from the middle.",
    "explanation": "Middle Out Thinking is a problem-solving approach that starts from the middle rather than purely top-down (from principles) or bottom-up (from details). Instead of beginning with abstract goals or granular data, you start with concrete, medium-level concepts and work both upward toward principles and downward toward specifics. This approach mirrors how many insights naturally emerge - from noticing patterns at an intermediate level. In PKM, it might mean starting with a specific project or question rather than a complete system or individual notes.",
