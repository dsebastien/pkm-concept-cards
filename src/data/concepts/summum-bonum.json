    "summary": "Latin for 'the highest good' - for Stoics, the highest good is virtue.",
    "explanation": "Summum Bonum is a Latin phrase meaning 'the highest good'. In Stoic philosophy, the highest good is virtue. If we act virtuously, then everything else that is important can follow. Acting virtuously isn't the easy path; it is the essential path. There will be many times when you are tested, and when you take the right track, you will often not be recognized or even appreciated. As Marcus Aurelius wrote: 'Do the right thing. The rest doesn't matter. Cold or warm. Tired or well-rested. Despised or honored.' This principle guides prioritization and decision-making by focusing on what truly matters most.",
