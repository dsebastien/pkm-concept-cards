    "summary": "The body's internal 24-hour clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles and numerous physiological processes.",
    "explanation": "Circadian rhythm is the body's internal biological clock that follows roughly a 24-hour cycle, regulating sleep-wake patterns, hormone release, body temperature, and metabolism. It's controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain and synchronized primarily by light exposure. Disruption of circadian rhythm—from shift work, jet lag, or irregular sleep schedules—impairs cognitive function, mood, immune function, and long-term health. Working with your circadian rhythm means scheduling demanding cognitive tasks during your peak alertness hours (typically morning for most people), protecting sleep timing, and getting morning light exposure. Understanding your chronotype (whether you're a morning person or night owl) helps optimize when you do different types of work for maximum effectiveness.",
