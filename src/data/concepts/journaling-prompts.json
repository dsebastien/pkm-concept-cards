    "explanation": "Journaling prompts are questions or statements designed to guide your reflection and help overcome the blank page syndrome. Useful prompts include: What did I do yesterday? Which problems did I face recently? How did I sleep? What is the most important thing I have to do today? What should I do next? What worked today? What failed today? What challenges am I facing? What did I learn today? What am I grateful for? What should I do tomorrow? What should I do next week? Having a set of go-to prompts makes it easier to start writing and ensures you cover important aspects of your day and life.",
