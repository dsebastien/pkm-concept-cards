    "summary": "Sharing your entrepreneurial journey openly - learnings, struggles, milestones, and metrics.",
    "explanation": "Building in Public is an entrepreneurship approach where you openly share your journey: what you learn, what you struggle with, discoveries, milestones, metrics, revenue numbers, strategic shifts, failures, ideas, and questions. This increases trust capital, connects you to people's minds, and helps productize yourself without creating a nameless brand. However, avoid sharing your competitive advantage, anything that could devalue your product or reputation, and revenue numbers for too long. Always accompany failures with lessons learned. The approach builds authentic relationships with your audience while documenting your journey.",
