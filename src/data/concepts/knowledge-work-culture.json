    "explanation": "Knowledge work culture refers to organizational values, norms, and practices that shape how cognitive and information work is done. Culture elements include: attitudes toward deep work vs. constant availability, learning and development emphasis, collaboration patterns, and autonomy levels. Healthy knowledge work cultures feature: respect for focused time, psychological safety, continuous learning support, and appropriate autonomy. Unhealthy cultures feature: constant interruption, blame-oriented responses, stagnation, and micromanagement. Culture shapes: whether deep work is possible, how knowledge is shared, whether people take risks, and whether learning is supported. Changing culture requires: leadership modeling, explicit norm-setting, system/process changes, and consistent reinforcement. Individuals can influence culture through: advocating for change, modeling desired behaviors, and finding like-minded collaborators. For knowledge workers, navigating culture means: understanding your organization's culture, working within or around constraints, contributing to positive culture development, and choosing organizations with compatible cultures.",
