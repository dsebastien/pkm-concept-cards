    "summary": "A network of interconnected concepts that form the structure of understanding in a knowledge base.",
    "explanation": "A Concept Network is the web of relationships between ideas in your knowledge base. Unlike a simple list or hierarchy, it represents how concepts relate to, support, contradict, or extend each other. Each concept is a node; each link is an edge representing a relationship. This network structure mirrors how human memory works - through associations rather than folders. Building a rich concept network helps with recall, creative thinking, and developing nuanced understanding of complex topics.",
