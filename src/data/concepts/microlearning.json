    "summary": "Learning in small, focused units that can be consumed in short time periods.",
    "explanation": "Microlearning delivers content in small, focused chunks - typically 3-10 minutes - that target specific learning objectives. Rather than hour-long lectures, microlearning uses short videos, flashcards, quick quizzes, or bite-sized readings. It aligns with how modern attention works and fits into busy schedules. Benefits include: reduced cognitive load, flexibility to learn in spare moments, immediate applicability, and easier updating of content. Microlearning works particularly well for: skill refreshers, just-in-time knowledge, procedural tasks, and spaced repetition systems. However, it's less suited for complex topics requiring sustained focus and deep understanding - breaking these into micro-pieces can fragment comprehension. For knowledge workers, microlearning is valuable for: continuous skill maintenance, staying current in rapidly changing fields, and maximizing learning from scattered available time.",
