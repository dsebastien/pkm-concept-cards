    "summary": "When too many options leads to difficulty deciding and reduced satisfaction.",
    "explanation": "Choice Overload (also known as the Paradox of Choice) occurs when having too many options makes decision-making harder rather than easier, often leading to anxiety, paralysis, or reduced satisfaction with the choice made. In PKM, this can manifest as tool hopping (too many tool options), template paralysis, or over-engineering systems. Constraints can be liberating. Sometimes limiting options and committing to a 'good enough' choice enables progress that perfect selection never would.",
