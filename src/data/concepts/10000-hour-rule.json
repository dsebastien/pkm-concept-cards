    "summary": "The idea that mastery requires roughly 10,000 hours of deliberate practice.",
    "explanation": "The 10,000 Hour Rule, popularized by Malcolm Gladwell, suggests that world-class expertise requires approximately 10,000 hours of deliberate practice. While the specific number is debated and varies by field, the core insight remains: mastery requires sustained, focused effort over years. This reframes expertise as achievable through dedication rather than innate talent. However, quality of practice matters more than quantity - 10,000 hours of unfocused repetition won't create expertise.",
