    "summary": "Leave things better than you found them.",
    "explanation": "The Boy Scout Rule states: 'Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.' Applied to knowledge work and PKM, this means making small improvements whenever you encounter something - fix a typo, add a link, clarify a note, organize a folder. Over time, these small improvements compound. You don't need dedicated maintenance sessions if you consistently make things a little better during regular use. This incremental approach keeps systems healthy without feeling burdensome.",
