    "summary": "A design framework with four phases: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver.",
    "explanation": "The Double Diamond is a design process framework developed by the British Design Council. It consists of four phases forming two diamonds: Discover (divergent - explore the problem broadly), Define (convergent - focus on the real problem), Develop (divergent - explore many solutions), Deliver (convergent - focus on the best solution). The key insight is alternating between divergent thinking (exploring possibilities) and convergent thinking (making decisions). This framework applies beyond design to problem-solving, research, and even organizing PKM systems.",
