    "summary": "The Latin phrase meaning 'by teaching, we learn' - teaching as a path to deeper understanding.",
    "explanation": "Docendo discimus (Latin for 'by teaching, we learn') is an ancient principle attributed to Seneca, capturing how teaching deepens the teacher's own understanding. The concept works because teaching requires: organizing knowledge clearly, identifying gaps in understanding, explaining at fundamental levels, and answering unexpected questions. Benefits of teaching include: discovering what you don't truly understand, strengthening memory through retrieval and articulation, deepening comprehension through explanation, and seeing knowledge from new perspectives. The principle applies beyond formal teaching to: explaining ideas to colleagues, writing about concepts, and mentoring others. The Feynman Technique leverages this - explaining something simply reveals whether you truly understand it. Teaching also motivates learning - knowing you'll teach creates purpose and engagement. For knowledge workers, docendo discimus suggests: explaining ideas to test understanding, writing about what you learn, mentoring others to deepen your own expertise, and using teaching as a learning strategy.",
