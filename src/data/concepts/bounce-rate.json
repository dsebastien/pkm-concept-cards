    "summary": "The percentage of visitors who leave a website after viewing only one page.",
    "explanation": "Bounce rate measures whether visitors engage beyond their entry point. A 'bounce' is a single-page session—someone arrives and leaves without clicking anything else. High bounce rates might indicate: content didn't match expectations, poor page experience, slow loading, or satisfied users (they found what they needed). Context matters: blog posts naturally have higher bounce rates than product pages; landing pages designed for conversion might have high 'bounces' that are actually successful form submissions. Reducing problematic bounce rates involves: matching content to search intent, improving page speed, clear navigation, compelling calls to action, and internal linking. For creators, bounce rate reveals whether your content hooks visitors or loses them immediately.",
