    "summary": "Mentally labeling experiences as they arise to maintain awareness and prevent getting lost in thought.",
    "explanation": "Noting is a meditation technique where you silently label or name experiences as they arise: 'thinking,' 'hearing,' 'tension,' 'planning,' 'itching.' The label is brief and gentle, just enough to acknowledge the experience before returning to open awareness. Noting serves several purposes: it keeps the mind engaged and prevents drowsiness, it maintains meta-awareness (knowing that you're knowing), it creates space between experience and reaction, and it develops insight into the patterns of your mind. Common noting categories include: sensations (seeing, hearing, feeling), mental activities (thinking, remembering, planning), and emotions (anger, joy, sadness). The noting style was developed in Mahasi Sayadaw's Burmese tradition and has been popularized in modern mindfulness. Over time, noting can become more subtle or even unnecessary as awareness stabilizes.",
