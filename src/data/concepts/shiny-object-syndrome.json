    "explanation": "Shiny Object Syndrome is the tendency to constantly chase new tools, methods, or systems instead of mastering and consistently using what you have. In PKM, it manifests as tool-hopping - endlessly switching between note-taking apps, always convinced the next tool will solve all problems. This prevents developing deep fluency with any system. The antidote is commitment: pick a good-enough tool and stick with it long enough to develop real proficiency before evaluating alternatives.",
