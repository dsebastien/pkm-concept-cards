    "summary": "The critical decision points or actions that have outsized impact on outcomes.",
    "explanation": "Hot Paths refer to the critical junctures, decisions, or actions that disproportionately determine outcomes. In software, hot paths are code executed most frequently. In life, they're the key moments that shape trajectories - career pivots, relationship decisions, habit formations. Identifying hot paths helps focus energy where it matters most. In PKM, understanding which notes, systems, or practices actually get used (vs. which are aspirational but unused) reveals the true hot paths in your workflow.",
