    "summary": "Using real-time body signals to learn conscious control of physiological processes.",
    "explanation": "Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic monitoring to provide real-time information about physiological processes, enabling you to learn conscious control over functions typically considered automatic. Sensors measure things like heart rate, muscle tension, skin conductance, brain waves, or breathing, displaying this information so you can observe the effects of relaxation, breathing, or mental states. Through this feedback loop, people learn to: reduce muscle tension, lower heart rate, improve heart rate variability, enter specific brain wave states, and regulate stress responses. Biofeedback is used for stress management, anxiety reduction, chronic pain, migraines, and peak performance training. Modern wearable devices have made basic biofeedback accessible for home practice. For knowledge workers, HRV biofeedback is particularly valuable for training stress resilience and recovery capacity.",
