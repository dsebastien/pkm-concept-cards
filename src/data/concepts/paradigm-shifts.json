    "summary": "Fundamental changes in underlying assumptions that transform understanding.",
    "explanation": "A Paradigm Shift, a concept from Thomas Kuhn's 'Structure of Scientific Revolutions,' is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and practices of a discipline. It's not incremental improvement but a wholesale transformation of how we see things - like the shift from Newtonian to quantum physics. In PKM, paradigm shifts might include: moving from folders to links, from collecting to connecting, from private notes to learning in public. Recognizing when a paradigm shift is needed (vs. incremental optimization) is crucial for growth.",
