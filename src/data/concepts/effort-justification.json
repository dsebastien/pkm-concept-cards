    "name": "Effort Justification",
    "summary": "A cognitive bias where people value outcomes more when they required significant effort to achieve.",
    "explanation": "Effort Justification is a cognitive bias first documented by Leon Festinger and later extensively studied in social psychology, where individuals attribute greater value to outcomes that required more effort, even when the objective value is the same. This is rooted in cognitive dissonance theory - when we expend significant effort, we need to justify that expenditure by believing the outcome was worth it. Classic examples include valuing IKEA furniture more because we assembled it ourselves (the 'IKEA effect'), hazing rituals making group membership feel more valuable, or appreciating a meal more when we cooked it from scratch. In productivity contexts, effort justification can be both beneficial and problematic. Beneficially, it increases engagement and satisfaction with completed work. Problematically, it can lead to: overvaluing inefficient processes simply because they're difficult, resistance to simplification ('we've always done it this hard way'), the sunk cost fallacy (continuing ineffective approaches because of prior effort), and undervaluing easier solutions. Awareness of this bias helps us evaluate outcomes based on their actual merit rather than the effort invested, and to embrace efficiency improvements without feeling like we're 'cheating.'",
