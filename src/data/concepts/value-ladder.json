    "summary": "A progression of offers that increase in value and price, guiding customers from low-commitment entry points to premium offerings.",
    "explanation": "The Value Ladder is a strategic framework for structuring products and services in ascending tiers of value and price. It typically starts with free or low-cost entry points (lead magnets, free content) that build trust and demonstrate value. As customers ascend, offerings become more valuable, personalized, and expensive: ebooks, courses, group coaching, one-on-one consulting, done-for-you services. Each rung serves different customer needs and commitment levels while increasing your revenue per customer. The ladder works because it meets people where they are—some can only afford $10, others will pay $10,000 for the right solution. For creators and knowledge workers, the value ladder transforms content into a business model: free content builds audience, low-ticket products convert followers, high-ticket offerings maximize lifetime value. The key is ensuring each level delivers genuine value that naturally creates desire for the next level.",
