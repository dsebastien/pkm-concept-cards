    "summary": "A layered highlighting method to distill information over time.",
    "explanation": "Progressive Summarization is Tiago Forte's layered highlighting method for distilling information. Instead of trying to summarize everything at once, you progressively add layers of highlighting as you revisit content: Layer 1 is the original notes, Layer 2 is bold highlighting of key passages, Layer 3 is highlighted portions of the bold text, Layer 4 is your own executive summary. This approach is really a mindful technique - a practice for fine-tuning intuition and self-awareness. It acknowledges that you don't know which information will be valuable until you need it.",
