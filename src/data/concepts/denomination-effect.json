    "summary": "A cognitive bias where people are less likely to spend larger denominations of currency than their equivalent value in smaller denominations.",
    "explanation": "The Denomination Effect is a cognitive bias describing the tendency for people to be less willing to spend money held in larger denominations compared to an equivalent amount in smaller bills or coins. For example, someone with a $100 bill is psychologically less likely to break it than someone with five $20 bills, even though both hold the same total value.\n\nThis phenomenon was extensively studied by researchers Priya Raghubir and Joydeep Srivastava, who published their findings in the Journal of Consumer Research in 2009. Their experiments demonstrated that participants given a single large bill spent significantly less than those given the equivalent amount in smaller denominations. In one study, participants with a $1 bill were more likely to purchase candy than those with a $1 coin of equal value, showing the effect extends beyond paper currency.\n\nThe psychological mechanism behind the Denomination Effect relates to how we mentally categorize money. Larger bills feel more valuable and substantial, creating a stronger psychological barrier to spending. Breaking a large bill feels like a more significant transaction, triggering loss aversion and making us more reluctant to part with it. Once broken, however, the smaller resulting bills are more easily spent, sometimes leading to the 'what the hell' effect where spending accelerates after the initial barrier is crossed.\n\nPractical applications of this knowledge include strategies for saving money: keeping savings in larger denominations makes them psychologically harder to spend. Conversely, retailers and casinos often exchange large bills for smaller ones or chips, making customers more willing to part with their money. Understanding this bias can help with personal budgeting - keeping discretionary spending money in large bills can naturally reduce impulse purchases, while being aware that breaking a large bill may lead to increased subsequent spending helps maintain financial discipline.",
