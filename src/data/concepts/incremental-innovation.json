    "summary": "Small, continuous improvements to existing products, processes, or services.",
    "explanation": "Incremental innovation involves making small, continuous improvements to existing products, services, or processes. Unlike radical innovation (paradigm shifts), incremental innovation refines what exists - better features, improved efficiency, enhanced usability. Examples include: new smartphone models with better cameras, software updates with new features, or process improvements that save time. Incremental innovation has advantages: lower risk, predictable returns, leverages existing capabilities, and satisfies current customers. However, it has limitations: won't create new markets, can miss disruptive threats, and may optimize the wrong things. Most organizational innovation is incremental - it's how companies stay competitive day-to-day. The key is balancing incremental improvement with occasional radical innovation. For knowledge workers, incremental innovation represents: the daily practice of making things slightly better, the value of continuous improvement, and the limitation of never taking larger leaps.",
