    "summary": "The practice of distributing knowledge, insights, and expertise to others.",
    "explanation": "Knowledge sharing is the practice of distributing knowledge, insights, and expertise to others within organizations, communities, or networks. It enables: collective intelligence (combining individual knowledge), capability building (developing others), and efficiency (avoiding repeated learning). Forms include: documentation (written knowledge capture), teaching (active knowledge transfer), mentoring (ongoing guidance), and collaboration (working together and learning). Barriers include: competitive cultures (knowledge as power), time constraints (sharing takes effort), poor systems (nowhere to share effectively), and tacit knowledge difficulties (some knowledge is hard to articulate). Enabling factors include: psychological safety, recognition for sharing, effective platforms, and cultures that value teaching. Effective knowledge sharing requires: willingness to share, ability to articulate knowledge, appropriate channels, and recipients ready to receive. For knowledge workers, practicing knowledge sharing means: documenting useful insights, helping colleagues learn, building organizational knowledge bases, and creating cultures where sharing is normal and valued.",
