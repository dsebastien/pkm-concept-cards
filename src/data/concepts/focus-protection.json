    "summary": "Deliberate strategies to defend focused work time from interruptions and distractions.",
    "explanation": "Focus protection involves deliberate strategies to defend concentrated work time from interruptions, distractions, and competing demands. Protection operates on multiple levels: environmental (closing doors, using signals), digital (blocking apps, managing notifications), social (communicating unavailability, setting expectations), and organizational (blocking calendars, declining meetings). Focus protection is necessary because: others will fill your time if you don't protect it, interruptions are costly beyond their duration, and valuable work often has no natural defender against shallow demands. Strategies include: visible signals (headphones, closed doors), unavailability periods (office hours for access), technology blockers, and explicit communication about focus needs. The challenge is balancing protection with accessibility and collaboration. For knowledge workers, focus protection is increasingly critical because: digital accessibility means constant potential interruption, and the value of knowledge work depends on concentrated cognitive effort.",
