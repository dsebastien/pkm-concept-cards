    "summary": "Using software to automate repetitive marketing tasks and nurture leads through personalized sequences.",
    "explanation": "Marketing automation handles repetitive tasks at scale: email sequences, lead scoring, social scheduling, ad management, and personalized content delivery. Key capabilities include: automated email nurturing (welcome sequences, abandoned cart, re-engagement), behavioral triggers (actions that start campaigns), lead scoring (prioritizing prospects by engagement), segmentation (grouping contacts for relevance), and analytics (tracking campaign performance). Automation doesn't replace strategy—it executes it efficiently. The goal is delivering the right message to the right person at the right time, automatically. For creators, automation handles subscriber onboarding, product delivery, and nurturing sequences while you focus on creating. Tools range from simple (ConvertKit, Mailchimp) to complex (HubSpot, ActiveCampaign).",
