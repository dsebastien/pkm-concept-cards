    "summary": "Information trapped in disconnected systems that cannot communicate with each other.",
    "explanation": "Personal Information Silos occur when your knowledge and data are scattered across multiple disconnected systems - notes in one app, bookmarks in another, emails in a third. These silos prevent information from connecting and compounding. You can't link ideas across systems, leading to fragmented thinking and lost insights. The solution is to consolidate information into a single source of truth or use interoperability tools. Recognizing silos is the first step toward building a more integrated personal knowledge management system.",
