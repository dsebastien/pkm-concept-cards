    "summary": "The compulsive need for urgent tasks and crises, avoiding important but non-urgent work.",
    "explanation": "Urgency addiction is the pattern of gravitating toward urgent tasks while neglecting important but non-urgent work. It manifests as: constantly fighting fires, feeling productive only under pressure, seeking adrenaline from deadlines, and discomfort with unstructured time. Urgency is addictive because it: provides clear direction (no ambiguity about what to do), creates dopamine hits from completion, and offers external validation (visible busyness). The cost is that important work - relationships, health, strategic thinking, prevention - gets perpetually deferred. Urgency addiction is reinforced by: organizational cultures that reward reactive work, technology that makes everything seem urgent, and personal avoidance of difficult important work. Breaking urgency addiction requires: recognizing the pattern, scheduling important non-urgent work, creating artificial urgency for important items, and building tolerance for less stimulating work. For knowledge workers, urgency addiction prevents: strategic thinking, relationship building, and the deep work that creates lasting value.",
