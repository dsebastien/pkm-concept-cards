    "summary": "Focus on what you can control (aim) while accepting what you cannot (wind, outcome).",
    "explanation": "The Stoic Archer is a metaphor from ancient Stoicism: an archer controls their aim, technique, and release but cannot control wind, target movement, or outcome. Success means doing everything within your control excellently, then accepting whatever results. This separates process (controllable) from outcome (not fully controllable). For knowledge workers, it means focusing on quality of work and learning rather than obsessing over metrics, recognition, or impact you can't directly control.",
