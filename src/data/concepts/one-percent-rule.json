    "summary": "In any Internet community, 1% of people create content, 9% contribute, and 90% lurk - aspire to be in the top 10%.",
    "explanation": "The 1% Rule (also known as the 90-9-1 principle or participation inequality) describes the typical distribution of participation in online communities:\n\n- **1% create**: These are the content creators, the ones who start discussions, write posts, create videos, or build something new.\n\n- **9% contribute**: These users engage with existing content - commenting, editing, rating, or sharing.\n\n- **90% lurk**: The vast majority consume content passively without visible participation.\n\nThis pattern appears consistently across platforms from Wikipedia to YouTube to forums.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n\n1. **Community building**: If you're building a community, expect most members to be silent. That's normal, not a problem.\n\n2. **Personal challenge**: Aspire to be in the top 10%! Moving from lurker to contributor to creator compounds your learning, builds your reputation, and creates opportunities.\n\n3. **Value creation**: The 1% create disproportionate value. Becoming a creator puts you in a position of influence.\n\n4. **Network effects**: Contribution is how you benefit most from communities - both learning and networking happen through engagement.",
