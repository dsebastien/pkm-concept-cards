    "explanation": "Focus rituals are consistent practices that signal the brain it's time for concentrated work. They serve as on-ramps to deep focus, creating reliable transitions from distraction to concentration. Examples include: specific beverages (coffee preparation), environment setup (closing apps, clearing desk), physical actions (putting on headphones, lighting a candle), or brief practices (writing session intentions, reviewing goals). Rituals work because: consistency builds associations (ritual = focus time), they create psychological permission to begin, and they provide buffer from prior distractions. Effective rituals are: short (under 5 minutes), consistent (same elements each time), and personally meaningful (not arbitrary). Rituals differ from procrastination when they're genuinely supportive and don't expand beyond their purpose. For knowledge workers, developing focus rituals means: identifying what reliably triggers focus mode, making those elements consistent, and protecting the ritual from becoming elaborate avoidance.",
