    "explanation": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files rather than manual processes. This enables version control, reproducibility, and automation of infrastructure changes. The principle extends beyond DevOps: treating systems as code means they can be documented, tested, and evolved systematically. In PKM, similar thinking applies to templates, workflows, and automation - codifying processes for consistency and improvement.",
