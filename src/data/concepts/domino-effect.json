    "summary": "A chain reaction where one event triggers a sequence of similar or related events.",
    "explanation": "A domino effect is a chain reaction - the cumulative effect produced when one event sets off a chain of events. Usually, the time between successive events in the chain is relatively small. The term can be used literally (series of collisions) or metaphorically. The domino effect implies that an event is inevitable or highly likely once the first domino falls, and conversely, that stopping the first event prevents the entire chain. In productivity and habit formation, this concept is valuable: one positive change can trigger others, creating momentum for transformation.",
