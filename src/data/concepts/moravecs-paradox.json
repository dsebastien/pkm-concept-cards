    "summary": "The observation that tasks easy for humans (like perception and movement) are hard for AI, while tasks hard for humans (like math and chess) are easy for AI.",
    "explanation": "Moravec's Paradox, articulated by roboticist Hans Moravec in the 1980s, reveals a counterintuitive truth about artificial intelligence: the skills we consider intellectually demanding are often the easiest for computers, while the 'simple' things we do without thinking are incredibly difficult to replicate.\n\nExamples of the paradox:\n- **Easy for AI, hard for humans**: Complex mathematics, playing chess at grandmaster level, processing millions of data points, perfect recall\n- **Easy for humans, hard for AI**: Recognizing faces in different lighting, walking on uneven terrain, understanding sarcasm, loading a dishwasher\n\nWhy this happens:\n- High-level reasoning is a recent evolutionary development with explicit, codifiable rules\n- Sensorimotor skills evolved over millions of years and are deeply optimized but implicit\n- Abstract thinking uses serial, conscious processing that's easy to program\n- Perception and motor control use massive parallel processing that's hard to replicate\n\nAs Moravec put it: 'It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.'\n\nImplications for knowledge work:\n- AI excels at tasks we find tedious (data analysis, summarization)\n- Humans remain superior at tasks requiring physical world understanding\n- The best results come from human-AI collaboration that leverages complementary strengths\n- Don't assume 'easy' tasks for you will be easy to automate",
