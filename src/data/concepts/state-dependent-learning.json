    "summary": "Information learned in one mental or physical state is better recalled in that same state.",
    "explanation": "State-dependent learning refers to the phenomenon where information learned in one physiological or psychological state is more easily retrieved when in that same state. This includes: emotional states (happy, sad, anxious), chemical states (caffeine, medication, alcohol), physical states (tired, energized), and even time of day. For example, something learned while caffeinated may be recalled better when caffeinated again. This has practical implications: if you always study with coffee, you might want coffee during the exam; if you learn new skills while calm, accessing them during stress may be harder. For knowledge workers, this suggests: building skills in varied states for flexibility, being aware of how your state affects recall, and practicing important skills in the states where you'll need them. It also explains why emotional memories are so vivid - they're encoded with strong state markers.",
