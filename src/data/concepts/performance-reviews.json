    "name": "Performance Reviews",
    "summary": "Formal assessments of employee performance, typically conducted annually or semi-annually.",
    "explanation": "Performance reviews are structured evaluations of an employee's job performance and contribution, typically conducted at regular intervals. While often criticized, well-designed review processes remain important for feedback, development, and organizational alignment.\n\nPurposes of performance reviews:\n\n1. Feedback - Provide clear assessment of performance\n2. Development - Identify growth areas and create plans\n3. Recognition - Acknowledge contributions and achievements\n4. Alignment - Connect individual work to company goals\n5. Compensation - Inform decisions about pay and promotion\n6. Documentation - Create a record for HR purposes\n\nCommon review formats:\n\n- Annual reviews (traditional, often criticized as too infrequent)\n- Semi-annual reviews (better frequency)\n- Continuous performance management (modern approach)\n- 360-degree feedback (multi-source input)\n- Self-assessments combined with manager ratings\n\nComponents of effective reviews:\n\n1. Backward-looking: What was accomplished?\n   - Goals achieved vs. set\n   - Key accomplishments\n   - Areas needing improvement\n   - Demonstrated competencies\n\n2. Forward-looking: What's next?\n   - Goals for next period\n   - Development priorities\n   - Career aspirations\n   - Support needed\n\nBest practices:\n\n- No surprises - feedback should be ongoing throughout the year\n- Specific examples, not vague generalizations\n- Balanced - acknowledge strengths and growth areas\n- Two-way conversation, not a monologue\n- Document agreements and action items\n- Follow up on development plans\n\nModern trends:\n\n- Continuous feedback replacing annual events\n- Separation of development from compensation discussions\n- More frequent, lighter-weight check-ins\n- Real-time feedback tools and apps\n- Focus on growth mindset and coaching\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n\n- Recency bias (only remembering recent events)\n- Halo/horn effect (one aspect colors everything)\n- Central tendency (rating everyone average)\n- Comparing employees to each other, not expectations\n- Making it one-directional (no employee input)",
