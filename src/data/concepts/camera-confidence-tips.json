    "explanation": "Camera confidence tips are practical strategies to help content creators feel more natural and confident when recording videos. These include preparation techniques (time blocking, removing friction, using a teleprompter), warmup exercises (vocal cord warmups, reciting with a pen in mouth, actor warmups), mindset practices (box breathing, meditation, self-forgiveness), physical exercises (stretching, walking, pushups), and approach strategies (imagining one viewer, using a rubber duck, talking as if to a friend). Building camera confidence is a gradual process that improves with consistent practice.",
