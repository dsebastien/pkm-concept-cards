    "summary": "Short-wavelength visible light that regulates circadian rhythm but can disrupt sleep when encountered at night.",
    "explanation": "Blue light refers to the portion of the visible light spectrum with wavelengths between approximately 380-500 nanometers. While all visible light affects our biology, blue light has particularly strong effects on our circadian rhythm, alertness, and sleep-wake cycle.\n\n**How Blue Light Affects the Body:**\n\nBlue light is detected by specialized photoreceptors (intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells) in the eye that communicate directly with the brain's circadian master clock (suprachiasmatic nucleus). When blue light hits these receptors, it suppresses the production of melatonin, the hormone that promotes sleep.\n\n**Beneficial Effects (During Daytime):**\n- Promotes alertness and cognitive performance\n- Elevates mood and well-being\n- Helps synchronize circadian rhythm\n- Improves reaction time and attention\n- Natural sunlight (rich in blue light) in the morning helps set the body's internal clock\n\n**Problematic Effects (At Night):**\n- Suppresses melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep\n- Delays circadian phase, shifting sleep schedule later\n- Reduces sleep quality and duration\n- Disrupts natural sleep-wake cycle\n- May contribute to long-term health issues when chronically misaligned\n\n**Common Sources of Blue Light:**\n- Sunlight (strongest natural source)\n- LED lights and CFLs\n- Digital screens (smartphones, tablets, computers, TVs)\n- Certain indoor lighting\n\n**Sleep Hygiene Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Morning Exposure**: Get bright light (ideally sunlight or 10,000 lux) in eyes within 30-60 minutes of waking to anchor circadian rhythm\n\n2. **Evening Avoidance**: Minimize blue light exposure 2-3 hours before bed:\n   - Use blue light blocking glasses (amber or red-tinted)\n   - Enable night mode/blue light filters on devices\n   - Dim indoor lighting\n   - Switch to red/amber lighting in evening\n\n3. **Screen Management**: Turn off screens 30-60 minutes before bed, or use aggressive filtering if unavoidable\n\n**Individual Variability:**\nSensitivity to blue light varies by age (children and adolescents are more sensitive), genetics, and individual chronotype. Evening blue light exposure affects \"night owls\" differently than \"morning larks.\"\n\nUnderstanding blue light helps optimize its benefits (daytime alertness) while minimizing sleep disruption (nighttime exposure). The goal isn't to eliminate blue light entirely but to align exposure with the body's natural circadian rhythm.",
