    "summary": "Personal objectives you set for yourself rather than those imposed by others.",
    "explanation": "Internal goals are your own objectives - the ones you set for yourself rather than those assigned by others or society. Achieving internal goals is meaningful and brings satisfaction and a genuine feeling of achievement. To pursue internal goals effectively, you need clarity about your priorities and must prioritize work that matters to you. This contrasts with external goals imposed by employers, society, or expectations. Working toward your internal goals creates intrinsic motivation and sustainable progress.",
