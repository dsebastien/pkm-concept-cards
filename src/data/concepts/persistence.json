    "summary": "The sustained effort and determination to continue pursuing goals despite obstacles.",
    "explanation": "To achieve great things, one must be persistent enough. Persistence is the quality of continuing steadily despite problems or difficulties. It's different from patience - patience implies waiting for things to improve on their own, while persistence means keeping your head down and continuing to work when things take longer than expected. Persistence beats timing, and execution beats luck - not immediately, but eventually. Combined with consistency and a clear vision, persistence turns impossible dreams into reality.",
