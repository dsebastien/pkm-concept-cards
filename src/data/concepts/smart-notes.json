    "summary": "Notes designed for reuse, connection, and long-term value.",
    "explanation": "Smart notes are notes designed to be reusable, well-connected, and provide long-term value - as opposed to 'dumb notes' that are written once and never revisited. Smart notes are building blocks - created once, used forever. They follow principles like atomicity, clear writing, proper linking, and standalone comprehensibility. Reusing previous notes and connecting those with other ones is a key aspect of creating smart notes. The concept is central to the How to Take Smart Notes methodology by Sönke Ahrens.",
