    "summary": "The principle that simplicity and restraint lead to better outcomes than excess.",
    "explanation": "Less is More is a timeless principle stating that simplicity, restraint, and reduction often produce better results than addition and excess. Freeing ourselves from desire is a shortcut to happiness. In productivity, having fewer tools and fewer commitments enables deeper focus. In PKM, fewer but well-maintained notes beat thousands of orphaned ones. In design, minimalism often communicates more effectively. This principle counters our natural tendency to add rather than subtract. When facing complexity, ask: what can I remove? The answer often leads to freedom, clarity, and better outcomes.",
