    "explanation": "Personal branding treats your professional reputation as an asset to be deliberately shaped. It encompasses: your unique value proposition (what you're known for), positioning (how you differ from others), visual identity (headshots, design style), content voice, and online presence. Effective personal branding requires clarity about who you serve and what you want to be known for—trying to appeal to everyone dilutes impact. Key channels include social media profiles, personal website, content creation, speaking, and networking. Personal branding matters because people buy from people they trust, opportunities flow to visible experts, and reputation compounds over time. For knowledge workers and creators, your personal brand often matters more than company affiliation.",
