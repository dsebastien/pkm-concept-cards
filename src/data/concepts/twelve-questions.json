    "summary": "A framework of guiding questions to drive curiosity and learning.",
    "explanation": "The 12 Favorite Questions technique, inspired by physicist Richard Feynman, involves maintaining a list of your most important open questions. When you encounter new information, you check whether it helps answer any of your questions. This creates a filter for what to capture and a framework for connecting new knowledge to your interests. The questions evolve over time as some get answered and new ones emerge.",
