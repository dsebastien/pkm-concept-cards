    "summary": "How gratitude practice builds psychological resilience and aids recovery from adversity.",
    "explanation": "Gratitude and resilience are connected through multiple mechanisms. Gratitude practice builds resilience by: developing positive emotion capacity, creating cognitive flexibility (finding positives amid negatives), strengthening social support networks, and building psychological resources during good times that help during hard times. During adversity, gratitude helps through: reframing (finding meaning in difficulty), perspective maintenance (recognizing what's still positive), and connection (appreciating support received). Research with trauma survivors shows gratitude practices aid recovery without denying or minimizing suffering. The connection is not about toxic positivity - genuine gratitude acknowledges difficulty while also recognizing what remains valuable. Building resilience through gratitude requires: consistent practice before crises (building capacity), flexible application during difficulty (not forced positivity), and genuine acknowledgment (not pretending things are better than they are). For knowledge workers, gratitude-based resilience means: maintaining perspective during work challenges, appreciating support systems, and using gratitude practices to recover from professional setbacks.",
