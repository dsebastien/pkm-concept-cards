    "summary": "Thinking that radiates outward from a central concept through associations.",
    "explanation": "Radiant Thinking, a concept from Tony Buzan, describes the brain's natural pattern of thinking that radiates outward from a central idea through countless associations in all directions. Like light rays emanating from a source, thoughts branch and connect endlessly. Mind maps are designed to capture radiant thinking visually. Understanding radiant thinking helps design PKM systems that align with how the brain naturally processes and connects information.",
