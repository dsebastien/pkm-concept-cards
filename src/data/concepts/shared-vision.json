    "explanation": "A shared vision is a common understanding of the future that the team wants to create. It is a powerful tool for aligning the team's efforts and motivating them to work towards a common goal. A shared vision helps to create a sense of purpose and direction, and it can inspire the team to achieve great things.\n\nCreating a shared vision is an essential part of the role of a leader. It requires the leader to communicate the vision clearly and consistently, and to involve the team in shaping the vision. A shared vision should be ambitious, but also realistic and achievable. It should be challenging, but also motivating and inspiring. It should be specific, but also flexible and adaptable.",
