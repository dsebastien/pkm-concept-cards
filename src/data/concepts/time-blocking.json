    "summary": "Scheduling specific blocks of time for different tasks or activities.",
    "explanation": "Time blocking is a time management method where you divide your day into blocks of time, each dedicated to a specific task or type of work. Instead of working from a to-do list and switching as needed, you assign tasks to specific time slots. Benefits include: reduced context switching, clearer priorities, better focus, and more realistic planning. Variations include day theming (dedicating entire days to types of work) and task batching (grouping similar tasks together).",
