    "summary": "Fragmented bits of time scattered throughout the day that are hard to use productively.",
    "explanation": "Time Confetti is a term coined by researcher Brigid Schulte to describe the scattered fragments of time that modern life leaves us with. These are the small pockets of 5-15 minutes between meetings, during commutes, or while waiting that feel too short to accomplish meaningful work. The problem with time confetti is that while we technically have free time, it's so fragmented that it's difficult to use productively. This fragmentation is exacerbated by constant interruptions from notifications, emails, and other digital distractions. Unlike a solid block of time that enables deep work and flow states, time confetti leaves us feeling simultaneously busy and unproductive. Strategies to combat time confetti include: batching similar tasks together, protecting larger time blocks for important work, reducing context switching, and being intentional about how you use small time gaps. Some people also practice having a list of 'time confetti tasks' - small, low-cognitive-load activities that can be completed in these fragmented moments.",
