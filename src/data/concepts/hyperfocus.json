    "explanation": "Hyperfocus is a state of intense, sustained concentration where you become completely absorbed in a task - time flies, distractions fade, and productivity peaks. It's closely related to flow state but emphasizes the extreme focus aspect. Characteristics: deep immersion (outside world fades), time distortion (hours feel like minutes), high productivity (work flows effortlessly), and reduced awareness (may miss meals, notifications). Hyperfocus can be: beneficial (for important, meaningful work), problematic (when focused on wrong things), and exhausting (intense focus depletes energy). Triggering hyperfocus: intrinsically interesting tasks (curiosity drives focus), clear goals (know what you're doing), appropriate challenge (not too easy, not too hard), and eliminated distractions (nothing competing for attention). Managing hyperfocus: direct it toward important tasks, use timers to prevent overdoing it, plan recovery time afterward, and be aware of hyperfocus on unproductive activities. For those with ADHD, hyperfocus is common - the challenge is directing it productively. For knowledge workers, hyperfocus represents: peak productivity states to cultivate, a resource to be directed wisely, and a state that requires deliberate entry and exit.",
