    "summary": "The accelerating pace of change driven by competition and innovation in modern society.",
    "explanation": "Everything is bound to accelerate exponentially in the coming years. Time is accelerating because of the 'Red Queen effect' - humanity is in a competition that pushes everyone and everything to innovate, improve, catch up with competitors, and deliver faster. Organizations compete for talent, companies compete for investors and customers, and this has profound effects on how fast our society evolves. There's an upcoming acceleration shock which will take us by surprise. Content creation, technological change, and environmental events all follow exponential curves. Our ability to learn faster will become ever more critical.",
