    "summary": "Attempting to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which reduces effectiveness.",
    "explanation": "Multitasking is the attempt to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Research consistently shows that true multitasking is a myth for complex cognitive work - what we actually do is rapid task-switching, which incurs significant mental costs. Each switch requires context-loading time and increases errors. For knowledge work, single-tasking with time blocking produces dramatically better results. The illusion of productivity from multitasking actually reduces deep work capacity and quality. Embracing single-tasking is essential for effective PKM and creative work.",
