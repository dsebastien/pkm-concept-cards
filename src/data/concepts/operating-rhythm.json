    "summary": "Recurring patterns of meetings, reviews, and activities that drive organizational execution.",
    "explanation": "Operating rhythm refers to the recurring patterns of meetings, reviews, check-ins, and activities that drive execution in organizations or personal productivity systems. It provides: predictability (everyone knows what happens when), accountability (regular review points), coordination (synchronization across teams), and momentum (continuous forward progress). Components include: daily standups or check-ins, weekly planning and review, monthly/quarterly business reviews, and annual planning cycles. Benefits include: reduced coordination overhead (scheduled touchpoints), early problem detection (regular reviews catch issues), consistent execution (rhythm creates habit), and reduced decision fatigue (standardized cadence). Design considerations: frequency appropriate to work type, duration proportional to value, clear purpose for each element, and flexibility within structure. Common patterns: daily tactical, weekly strategic, monthly operational, quarterly directional. For knowledge workers, establishing operating rhythm means: designing personal review cadences, coordinating with team rhythms, and balancing structure with flexibility for deep work.",
