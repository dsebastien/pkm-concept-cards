    "summary": "A self-reinforcing cycle where content attracts audience, which generates more content and growth.",
    "explanation": "The Audience Acquisition Flywheel is a growth mechanism where each action feeds the next: Content attracts audience → Audience provides feedback and engagement → Insights improve future content → Better content attracts more audience. Unlike linear marketing, flywheels compound over time. Early momentum is slow, but once spinning, the flywheel becomes increasingly powerful. For creators, building a flywheel means designing systems where success breeds more success through network effects, referrals, and compound learning.",
