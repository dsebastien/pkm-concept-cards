    "explanation": "The Capture Habit is the trained behavior of immediately capturing thoughts, ideas, and information before they're forgotten. It's the foundation of effective PKM. The habit requires: having capture tools always accessible, low friction for creating captures, and trust that captured items will be processed. Without the capture habit, valuable ideas are lost constantly. With it, your knowledge system grows continuously. Building this habit takes deliberate practice until it becomes automatic.",
