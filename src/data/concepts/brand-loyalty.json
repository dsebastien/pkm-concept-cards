    "summary": "A customer's commitment to repeatedly purchase or support a particular brand over competitors.",
    "explanation": "Brand loyalty goes beyond repeat purchases to emotional commitment—loyal customers choose your brand even when alternatives are cheaper or more convenient. Loyalty develops through: consistent positive experiences, emotional connections, shared values, community belonging, and accumulated switching costs. Loyal customers are valuable because they: cost less to retain than acquire, buy more over time, pay premium prices, refer others, and forgive occasional mistakes. Loyalty programs can reinforce behavior but don't create true loyalty—that requires genuine value and relationship. For creators, loyal audiences engage consistently, buy multiple products, defend you publicly, and become ambassadors. Building loyalty means consistently delivering on promises and exceeding expectations.",
