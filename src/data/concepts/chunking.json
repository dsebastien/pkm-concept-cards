    "explanation": "Chunking is the cognitive process of grouping individual pieces of information into larger, meaningful units (chunks) to enhance memory and comprehension. Phone numbers are chunked into groups of digits; complex skills are chunked into component sub-skills. In PKM, chunking helps organize information - grouping related notes, creating hierarchies, and building conceptual frameworks. Atomic notes can be chunked together through links and MoCs to form larger understanding.",
