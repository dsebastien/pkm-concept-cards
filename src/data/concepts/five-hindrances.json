    "summary": "Five mental states in Buddhist psychology that obstruct meditation and spiritual progress.",
    "explanation": "The Five Hindrances (Pañca Nīvaraṇāni in Pali) are fundamental obstacles in Buddhist meditation practice that prevent the mind from achieving concentration and insight. These are not permanent personality traits but temporary mental states that arise and pass.\n\nThe five hindrances are:\n\n**1. Sensory Desire (Kāmacchanda)**: Craving for pleasant sensory experiences - sights, sounds, tastes, smells, or physical sensations. In meditation, this manifests as fantasies, planning pleasurable activities, or seeking comfort.\n\n**2. Ill-will or Aversion (Vyāpāda)**: Anger, resentment, irritation, or aversion toward anything unpleasant. This includes anger at oneself, frustration with the meditation practice, or dwelling on grievances.\n\n**3. Sloth and Torpor (Thīna-middha)**: Mental and physical sluggishness, drowsiness, lack of energy, or dullness. The mind feels heavy, foggy, or tends toward sleep rather than alert awareness.\n\n**4. Restlessness and Worry (Uddhacca-kukkucca)**: Mental agitation, anxiety, restlessness, or worry about past actions or future concerns. The mind jumps from thought to thought without settling.\n\n**5. Doubt (Vicikicchā)**: Skeptical doubt about the practice, the teaching, one's ability, or whether meditation is worthwhile. This includes chronic indecision and lack of confidence.\n\nBuddhist teachings offer specific antidotes for each hindrance: cultivating opposite qualities, understanding their impermanent nature, and developing mindful awareness that recognizes hindrances without being controlled by them. When hindrances are temporarily suspended, the mind can access deeper states of concentration (jhana/samadhi) and develop insight.\n\nUnderstanding the Five Hindrances provides a practical framework for recognizing and working with common obstacles in any contemplative practice or focused mental work.",
