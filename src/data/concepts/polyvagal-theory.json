    "summary": "Stephen Porges' theory of a three-part nervous system hierarchy: social engagement, fight/flight, and freeze.",
    "explanation": "Polyvagal Theory, developed by Stephen Porges, describes the autonomic nervous system as having three hierarchical states: ventral vagal (social engagement), sympathetic (fight/flight), and dorsal vagal (freeze/shutdown). We cycle through these states based on perceived safety. Ventral vagal: feeling safe, connected, able to socially engage - this is optimal for learning, creativity, and connection. Sympathetic: mobilized for action, anxious, or angry - useful for actual threats but chronic activation is harmful. Dorsal vagal: shutdown, disconnection, dissociation - the primitive response to overwhelming threat. The theory explains why connection calms (co-regulation), why trauma can cause shutdown, and why feeling safe is prerequisite for higher functions. For knowledge workers, understanding polyvagal theory helps: recognize your state, create conditions for ventral vagal access (safety, connection), and understand why stress impairs cognitive function.",
