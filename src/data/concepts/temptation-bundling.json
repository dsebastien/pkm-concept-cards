    "summary": "Pairing an activity you want to do with an activity you should do to make productive behaviors more enjoyable.",
    "explanation": "Temptation Bundling is a behavioral economics strategy coined by Katy Milkman, a professor at the Wharton School. The idea is simple: link an activity you enjoy (a 'want') with an activity you should do but often avoid (a 'should'). By bundling temptations with productive tasks, you create a positive association that makes the less appealing activity more attractive. Classic examples include: only listening to your favorite podcast while exercising, only watching TV while folding laundry, or only getting a pedicure while processing work emails. The technique leverages our natural desire for immediate gratification by making it contingent on productive behavior. This is different from rewarding yourself after completing a task; instead, you experience the reward simultaneously with the task. Temptation bundling works because it transforms 'should' activities from pure costs into experiences with built-in benefits. The key is finding genuine pairings where the enjoyable activity enhances rather than distracts from the productive one.",
