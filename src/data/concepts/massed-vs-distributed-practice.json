    "summary": "Cramming (massed) versus spreading practice over time (distributed) - distributed wins for retention.",
    "explanation": "Massed practice means studying or practicing in concentrated sessions (cramming), while distributed practice (also called spaced practice) spreads the same amount of practice over time with gaps in between. Over a century of research consistently shows that distributed practice leads to better long-term retention, even though massed practice often feels more effective in the moment. The 'spacing effect' is one of psychology's most robust findings. Why does it work? Spacing allows some forgetting to occur, making retrieval more effortful and thus more strengthening. It also provides more opportunities for the brain to consolidate information during sleep. For learners, this means: spread study sessions across days rather than hours, return to material after gaps, and resist the temptation to cram even though it feels productive. The discomfort of spaced practice is actually a sign it's working.",
