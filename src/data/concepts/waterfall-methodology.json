    "summary": "A sequential project management approach where phases flow downward like a waterfall.",
    "explanation": "The Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach to project management where progress flows steadily downward through distinct phases. Each phase must be completed before the next begins, like water flowing over a series of steps.\n\nThe classic phases:\n\n1. **Requirements** - Gather and document all requirements upfront\n2. **Design** - Create system architecture and detailed design\n3. **Implementation** - Build the system according to design\n4. **Verification/Testing** - Test against requirements\n5. **Deployment** - Release to production\n6. **Maintenance** - Ongoing support and updates\n\nKey characteristics:\n\n- Sequential progression through phases\n- Extensive upfront planning and documentation\n- Formal sign-offs between phases (gates)\n- Changes are difficult and expensive once a phase completes\n- Emphasis on comprehensive documentation\n- Clear milestones and deliverables\n\nWhen Waterfall works well:\n\n- Requirements are well-understood and stable\n- Technology is mature and understood\n- Short projects with clear scope\n- Regulatory environments requiring documentation\n- Hardware projects or physical construction\n- Integration with external systems requiring fixed specs\n\nLimitations:\n\n- Late discovery of problems (testing comes last)\n- Difficulty accommodating change\n- Customer doesn't see working product until late\n- Assumes perfect understanding upfront\n- Risk of building the wrong thing\n- Long time to market\n\nWaterfall vs. Agile:\n\nWaterfall is often contrasted with Agile methodologies. Waterfall assumes you can know everything upfront; Agile assumes you'll learn as you go. The Agile Manifesto was largely a response to Waterfall's limitations in software development.\n\nModern perspective:\n\nFew teams use pure Waterfall today in software. However, elements of Waterfall thinking (upfront planning, phase gates, documentation) are often combined with iterative approaches in hybrid methodologies.",
