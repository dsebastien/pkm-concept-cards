    "summary": "Search queries where users get answers directly in results without clicking through to any website.",
    "explanation": "Zero-click searches occur when search engines provide answers directly—through featured snippets, knowledge panels, instant answers, or AI summaries—eliminating the need to visit websites. Studies suggest over 50% of searches now end without a click. This challenges traditional SEO: ranking #1 doesn't guarantee traffic if Google answers the question itself. Implications include: focus on queries that require deeper engagement, optimize for brand visibility (even without clicks), create content that demands full consumption, and build direct audience relationships (email, community) independent of search traffic. For creators, zero-click search means: some content builds brand awareness without visits, some queries aren't worth targeting, and owning your audience through email/community becomes more critical.",
