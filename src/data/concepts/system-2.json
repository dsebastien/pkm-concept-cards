    "explanation": "System 2 is the second mode of thinking in Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory from \"Thinking, Fast and Slow.\" It represents slow, effortful, deliberate, and conscious cognitive processes used for complex reasoning, calculation, and careful decision-making.\n\nCharacteristics of System 2:\n\n**Effortful and Deliberate**: Requires conscious attention and mental energy. You must actively choose to engage System 2.\n\n**Slow**: Takes time to process information methodically and reach conclusions.\n\n**Logical**: Uses step-by-step reasoning, analysis, and systematic thinking.\n\n**Controlled**: Can be directed voluntarily toward specific tasks or problems.\n\n**Limited Capacity**: Can only handle a small number of things at once due to working memory constraints.\n\n**Mentally Taxing**: Drains cognitive resources and can lead to mental fatigue.\n\n**Interruptible**: Can be disrupted by distractions or cognitive load.\n\nExamples of System 2 thinking:\n- Solving \"17 × 24 = ?\"\n- Filling out a tax form\n- Parking in a narrow space (for most people)\n- Comparing two products on multiple features\n- Learning a new skill or concept\n- Checking the validity of a complex logical argument\n- Planning a multi-step project\n- Deliberately controlling emotional reactions\n\nSystem 2 serves several critical functions:\n\n**Monitoring and Control**: Oversees System 1's automatic responses and can override them when needed (though this requires effort and often doesn't happen).\n\n**Complex Problem Solving**: Handles tasks too complicated for System 1's pattern-matching abilities.\n\n**Rule Following**: Applies explicit rules, procedures, and learned algorithms.\n\n**Rational Choice**: Makes deliberate decisions based on careful analysis rather than intuition.\n\nHowever, System 2 has limitations:\n- It's lazy—tends to accept System 1's quick answers rather than doing the hard work of analysis\n- It's easily depleted by mental effort (ego depletion)\n- It's slow and can't handle everything, so we rely heavily on System 1\n- People often believe they're using System 2 when they're actually rationalizing System 1's intuitive judgments\n\nUnderstanding System 2 helps us recognize when to slow down and think deliberately rather than relying on automatic responses. Important decisions, unfamiliar situations, and critical analysis all benefit from engaging System 2, even though it requires more effort.",
