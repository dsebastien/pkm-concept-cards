    "summary": "A framework for categorizing decisions as one-way doors (Type 1) or two-way doors (Type 2).",
    "explanation": "Jeff Bezos popularized this decision-making framework at Amazon to prevent both excessive caution and recklessness. Type 1 decisions are irreversible, consequential, and nearly impossible to walk back - like selling your company or making a major strategic pivot. These deserve careful analysis and broad input. Type 2 decisions are reversible, like launching a feature or trying a new process - if it doesn't work, you can change course with minimal cost. The problem is that organizations often treat all decisions as Type 1, leading to slowness and risk aversion. Most decisions are actually Type 2 and should be made quickly by individuals or small groups. Recognizing which type you're facing helps you allocate the right amount of time, resources, and deliberation to each decision.",
