    "summary": "A therapeutic approach focusing on engaging in meaningful activities to improve mood and break depression cycles.",
    "explanation": "Behavioral activation (BA) is an evidence-based treatment for depression that works by increasing engagement in activities that bring pleasure, mastery, or connection. Depression often creates a vicious cycle: low mood leads to withdrawal from activities, which reduces positive experiences, further lowering mood. BA interrupts this cycle by scheduling activities regardless of current motivation, based on the principle that action precedes motivation rather than following it. Key elements include: identifying values and meaningful activities, scheduling small achievable tasks, monitoring mood in relation to activities, and gradually increasing engagement. BA is effective because it provides natural rewards (dopamine), creates structure, rebuilds confidence through accomplishment, and reconnects people with what matters. The principle applies beyond clinical depression: when stuck, action often works better than waiting for motivation.",
