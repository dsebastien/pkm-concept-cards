    "summary": "The capacity to recover from difficulties, adapt to change, and keep going in the face of adversity.",
    "explanation": "Resilience is the psychological capacity to cope with stress and adversity, bouncing back from setbacks and even growing stronger through challenges. It's not about avoiding difficulty but about how we respond to it. Resilience is not a fixed trait but a set of skills and mindsets that can be developed. Key components include: emotional regulation (managing distress without being overwhelmed), cognitive flexibility (reframing setbacks), sense of purpose (meaning that sustains effort), social connection (support networks), and self-efficacy (belief in your ability to cope). Resilient people view failures as learning opportunities, maintain perspective during crises, and take purposeful action rather than feeling helpless. Building resilience involves practicing stress management, cultivating supportive relationships, developing problem-solving skills, and nurturing a growth mindset.",
