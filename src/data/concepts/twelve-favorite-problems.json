    "explanation": "The 12 Favorite Problems concept, attributed to Richard Feynman, involves maintaining a list of important questions or problems that fascinate you. As you encounter new information, you test it against these problems - does it help solve any of them? This practice turns passive learning into active problem-solving. Your favorite problems guide reading choices, spark creative connections, and give direction to your knowledge accumulation. They're questions you return to repeatedly throughout your life.",
