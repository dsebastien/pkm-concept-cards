    "name": "Zebras vs Unicorns",
    "summary": "Zebra companies aim to be profitable while improving society, unlike growth-obsessed unicorns.",
    "explanation": "Zebras vs Unicorns represents two opposing business philosophies. Unicorns are startups valued at $1B+, focused on rapid growth, venture capital, and market domination - often at any cost. Zebras take a different approach: they're not here to sacrifice themselves for growth. They aim to be profitable while improving society. They're enthusiastic, optimistic, and profoundly human. Scale and growth don't matter to them - being a calm business is fine. Zebras fix what unicorns break. The zebra movement advocates for businesses that are both black AND white: profitable AND good for society, rather than choosing one at the expense of the other.",
