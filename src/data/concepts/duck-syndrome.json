    "explanation": "Duck Syndrome describes a phenomenon where people appear placid and in control on the surface while frantically struggling underneath - like a duck gliding smoothly across water while paddling furiously below. Common in high-achieving environments like universities and competitive workplaces, sufferers experience clinical depression, anxiety, or other mental health challenges while hiding their struggles. Risk factors include stress, personal and familial tendencies to over-emphasize achievement, and family overprotection. Symptoms include appearing composed superficially while covertly failing to keep up with overwhelming demands, and feeling that everyone else is faring better. This creates a dangerous cycle where everyone hides their struggles, making others feel even more isolated in theirs.",
