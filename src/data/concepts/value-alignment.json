    "summary": "Matching behavior, decisions, and life design to personal core values.",
    "explanation": "Value alignment is the practice of matching behavior, decisions, and life design to personal core values - living in accordance with what you believe matters most. Misalignment occurs when: stated values differ from lived values, daily actions contradict priorities, and work or relationships conflict with core beliefs. Alignment involves: identifying core values (what truly matters to you), auditing life against values (where is behavior misaligned?), and adjusting toward alignment (changing behavior or environment). Benefits of alignment include: reduced internal conflict, greater sense of integrity, improved decision-making, and increased life satisfaction. Barriers include: lack of clarity about values, social pressure toward misalignment, and short-term incentives contradicting long-term values. Achieving alignment requires: reflection on values, honesty about current state, and willingness to make changes. Value alignment is ongoing - as life changes, alignment requires continuous attention. For knowledge workers, value alignment means: choosing work that reflects values, making decisions consistently with priorities, and recognizing when misalignment is causing dissatisfaction.",
