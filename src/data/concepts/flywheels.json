    "explanation": "A Flywheel is a self-reinforcing cycle where each step feeds into the next, building momentum over time. Popularized by Jim Collins in Good to Great, the concept applies to PKM: capturing knowledge makes you smarter, which helps you create better content, which attracts more opportunities to learn, which gives you more to capture. Unlike one-time efforts, flywheels compound - the more you push, the easier it becomes. Building personal flywheels around learning, creating, and connecting is key to long-term success.",
