    "summary": "Asking 'why' repeatedly to drill down to the root cause of a problem.",
    "explanation": "The Five Whys is a problem-solving technique developed by Sakichi Toyoda and used at Toyota. By asking 'why' five times (or more), you drill past symptoms to find the root cause of a problem. Example: 'Why did the project fail?' → 'Requirements were unclear' → 'Why?' → 'No stakeholder interviews' → 'Why?' → 'No time allocated' → 'Why?' → 'Planning process doesn't include discovery phase.' This reveals systemic issues rather than surface symptoms. Useful for PKM when diagnosing why a system isn't working.",
