    "explanation": "Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) is the realistic share of SAM you can actually capture in the near term, considering your current resources, competition, and market conditions. While TAM and SAM describe potential, SOM is your practical, achievable target. For new creators, SOM might be just 1-2% of SAM initially. SOM grounds strategy in reality and helps set achievable milestones while keeping the larger opportunity in mind.",
