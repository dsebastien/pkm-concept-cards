    "summary": "The Zen concept meaning 'nothing' or 'not' - transcending yes and no.",
    "explanation": "Mu is a Zen term meaning 'nothing,' 'not,' or 'without' - representing a response that transcends the dualistic framework of yes and no. The famous koan asks: 'Does a dog have Buddha nature?' The master Joshu answered 'Mu.' This response is not: a simple no, a philosophical position, or something to understand intellectually. Mu points to: the inadequacy of binary thinking, reality beyond conceptual categories, and the emptiness that enables all forms. As a meditation practice, concentrating on 'Mu' is meant to: exhaust the conceptual mind, break through dualistic thinking, and potentially trigger satori. Mu represents: the limits of language and logic, the space before concepts arise, and the 'don't know' mind that is open to reality. The concept teaches: some questions are based on false premises, reality exceeds our categories, and breakthrough may require abandoning familiar frameworks. For knowledge workers, Mu suggests: questioning question premises, recognizing limits of binary thinking, and maintaining openness when frameworks fail.",
