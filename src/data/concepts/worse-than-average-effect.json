    "name": "Worse-Than-Average Effect",
    "summary": "A cognitive bias where people underestimate their abilities relative to others on difficult or rare tasks, believing themselves to be below average.",
    "explanation": "The Worse-Than-Average Effect is a cognitive bias in which individuals underestimate their own abilities compared to others, particularly when it comes to difficult tasks or rare skills. Unlike its counterpart, the better-than-average effect (where people overestimate their abilities on easy tasks), this bias manifests when people believe they are less competent than the average person in domains they perceive as challenging or uncommon.\n\nThis phenomenon is closely related to the hard-easy effect, which describes how people tend to be overconfident about difficult tasks and underconfident about easy ones. The worse-than-average effect represents the social comparison aspect of this bias - when tasks are perceived as difficult, people assume that others must be handling them better than they are. The logic seems to be: 'If I find this hard, surely everyone else finds it easier.'\n\nThe effect emerges from several psychological mechanisms. First, when we struggle with a task, we have direct access to our own difficulties but lack visibility into others' struggles. Second, we often overestimate the base rate of certain skills in the population - assuming more people can juggle, speak multiple languages, or perform advanced mathematics than actually can. Third, there's an anchoring effect where perceived task difficulty shifts our self-assessment downward.\n\nResearch has demonstrated this effect across various domains: people underestimate their ability to perform uncommon tasks like unicycling, juggling, or programming; they rate themselves as below average on intellectually demanding tasks; and they show pessimism about rare positive events happening to them.\n\nUnderstanding this bias is important for accurate self-assessment. While the better-than-average effect can lead to overconfidence, the worse-than-average effect can lead to unnecessary self-doubt, imposter syndrome, and avoiding challenges where one might actually excel. To counteract this bias, seek objective performance feedback, compare your abilities against actual base rates rather than imagined ones, and remember that difficulty you experience does not mean others find the same task effortless.",
