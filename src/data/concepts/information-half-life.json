    "summary": "The time period over which information loses half its value or relevance.",
    "explanation": "Information half-life describes how quickly information becomes obsolete or loses value. Like radioactive decay, different types of information have different half-lives: breaking news becomes stale within hours, technical documentation may last years, and timeless principles persist for centuries. Understanding information half-life helps prioritize learning: time spent on quickly-decaying information (current events, trending topics) may be wasted if that information is irrelevant by tomorrow. Conversely, investing in long-half-life knowledge (fundamental principles, human nature, systems thinking) compounds over time. The concept suggests a strategy: consume less news (short half-life) and more books (longer half-life), focus on principles over tactics, and ask 'will this matter in 10 years?' before investing attention. For knowledge workers, information half-life thinking means: building knowledge bases that remain valuable, avoiding over-investment in transient trends, and recognizing that timeless information is the best investment.",
