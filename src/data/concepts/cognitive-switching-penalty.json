    "explanation": "Cognitive switching penalty refers to the mental cost, time loss, and performance degradation that occurs when shifting between different tasks or contexts. Research shows: task switching isn't instantaneous - mental residue from the previous task persists, recovery takes time, and frequent switching compounds losses. The penalty includes: time to reorient (loading context into working memory), attention residue (thoughts from previous task lingering), and quality degradation (shallow engagement with each task). Factors affecting severity include: task complexity, task similarity, and switching frequency. The penalty is: worse for complex tasks, reduced with related tasks, and cumulative with frequent switches. Even 'quick' interruptions cause significant penalties - checking email for 'just a minute' can cost 15+ minutes of recovery. For knowledge workers, understanding this penalty suggests: batching similar tasks, protecting focus time, minimizing context switches, and recognizing that multitasking's apparent efficiency is often illusory.",
