    "summary": "Using testing and recall as a learning strategy, not just an assessment method.",
    "explanation": "Retrieval practice is the strategy of actively recalling information from memory as a way to strengthen learning. Rather than passively reviewing material, you test yourself - through flashcards, practice questions, free recall, or explaining from memory. Research consistently shows that the act of retrieval itself strengthens memory more effectively than additional study time. This is the testing effect applied as a deliberate learning strategy. Key principles: retrieval should be challenging (easy recall doesn't strengthen memory much), immediate feedback helps correct errors, and spacing retrieval over time maximizes long-term retention. Retrieval practice is most effective when combined with: interleaving (mixing topics), spacing (distributed practice), and elaboration (explaining why answers are correct). For knowledge workers, retrieval practice means: self-quizzing regularly, trying to recall before checking notes, and using tools like flashcard apps strategically.",
