    "summary": "The hidden accumulation of digital files, emails, apps, and information that silently impacts productivity, increases stress, and creates cognitive overload.",
    "explanation": "Digital clutter refers to the excessive accumulation of digital files, emails, applications, notifications, bookmarks, photos, downloads, and other digital assets that we collect over time. Unlike physical clutter, digital clutter is particularly insidious because it hides from plain sight. You don't see it piling up on your desk or floor, yet it can have the same negative effects as physical clutter: making you feel disorganized, unproductive, and stressed.\n\nThe sneaky nature of digital clutter lies in its invisibility. Files accumulate silently in cloud storage, emails pile up in inboxes, browser tabs multiply, and downloads folder grows endlessly - all out of sight and often out of mind. This hidden mess creates cognitive load as your brain subconsciously tracks all these loose ends, contributing to decision fatigue and mental exhaustion.\n\nThe effects of digital clutter are significant: it increases cognitive load by forcing your brain to process and filter through unnecessary information, causes decision fatigue from constantly choosing what to keep or delete, generates stress from feeling overwhelmed by unmanaged digital spaces, and reduces productivity by making it harder to find what you actually need.\n\nCombating digital clutter requires intentional practices: practicing Inbox Zero to keep email manageable, conducting regular audits of file storage with clear folder structures, treating your desktop as a temporary repository rather than a dumping ground, curating photos ruthlessly (keeping only what you'd put in a physical album), auditing social media follows to reduce timeline noise, and embracing digital minimalism principles. Regular cleanup sessions, just like tidying physical spaces, help maintain digital hygiene and mental clarity.",
