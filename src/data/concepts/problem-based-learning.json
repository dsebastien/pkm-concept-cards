    "summary": "Learning through solving authentic, complex problems rather than studying subjects first.",
    "explanation": "Problem-based learning (PBL) is an educational approach where learning is driven by working on complex, real-world problems. Instead of learning subjects then applying them, students encounter problems first and learn what's needed to solve them. PBL originated in medical education at McMaster University and has spread across disciplines. Key elements include: authentic problems without clear solutions, student-directed investigation, collaborative learning, facilitators who guide rather than lecture, and reflection on learning process. PBL develops: problem-solving skills, critical thinking, collaboration, self-directed learning ability, and deeper content knowledge. For knowledge workers, adopting PBL principles means: learning by tackling real challenges, identifying knowledge gaps in context, and using problems as organizing structures for learning. Projects become learning opportunities, not just work to complete.",
