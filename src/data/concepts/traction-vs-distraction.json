    "name": "Traction vs Distraction",
    "summary": "Traction pulls you toward your goals while distraction pulls you away; they are opposite forces competing for your attention.",
    "explanation": "The opposite of distraction is not focus - it's traction. Understanding this reframe can transform how you think about productivity.\n\n**Traction** is anything that pulls you toward achieving your goals. It's forward movement in the direction you want to go.\n\n**Distraction** is anything that pulls you away from achieving your goals. It's movement in the wrong direction.\n\nThis framework is powerful because:\n\n1. **It clarifies intent**: The same activity can be traction or distraction depending on your goals. Watching a movie is traction if your goal is rest, but distraction if your goal is finishing a project.\n\n2. **It's action-oriented**: Rather than abstractly thinking about 'being focused,' you can ask: 'Is this creating traction or distraction?'\n\n3. **It removes judgment**: Neither is inherently good or bad - they're directional forces relative to your goals.\n\nTo gain traction:\n- Get clear on what your goals actually are\n- Recognize when you're being pulled away\n- Design your environment to create traction by default\n- Use time-blocking to protect traction time\n\nWhen you have a plan, distraction becomes obvious because you know exactly what you're giving up.",
