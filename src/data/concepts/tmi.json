    "summary": "Sharing more information than is appropriate or useful for the context.",
    "explanation": "TMI (Too Much Information) refers to sharing details that are excessive, inappropriate, or counterproductive for the situation. In personal contexts, it means oversharing private details. In professional contexts, it means burying the key message in unnecessary detail. TMI reflects a failure to match information to audience needs. Effective communication requires filtering - knowing what to include and what to leave out. The goal is providing exactly what's needed, not everything you know.",
