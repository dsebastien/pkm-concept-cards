    "summary": "The twelve progressive stages from excessive ambition to complete physical and mental collapse.",
    "explanation": "Burnout progresses through twelve distinct phases: (1) Excessive drive and ambition, feeling a need to prove yourself; (2) Pushing yourself to work harder; (3) Neglecting your own needs like sleep, exercise, and nutrition; (4) Displacement of conflict, blaming others instead of acknowledging overwork; (5) No time for non-work needs, withdrawing from social life; (6) Denial and blaming others as incompetent; (7) Withdrawal from family and friends; (8) Behavioral changes, becoming aggressive; (9) Depersonalization, feeling detached from your life; (10) Inner emptiness or anxiety, possibly leading to substance use; (11) Depression and hopelessness; (12) Mental or physical collapse requiring professional help. Recognizing early phases enables intervention before severe consequences.",
