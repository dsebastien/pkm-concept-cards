    "explanation": "The Procrastination Equation, developed by Piers Steel, models motivation as: Motivation = (Expectancy × Value) / (Impulsiveness × Delay). Expectancy is your confidence in success; Value is how rewarding the task is; Impulsiveness is your sensitivity to immediate rewards; Delay is how far off the reward is. Procrastination increases when: expectancy is low (you doubt success), value is low (task seems pointless), impulsiveness is high (you're easily distracted), or delay is high (payoff is distant). The equation suggests intervention points: boost expectancy (break into achievable steps, recall past successes), increase value (connect to meaning, add rewards), reduce impulsiveness (remove distractions, use commitment devices), and reduce perceived delay (set intermediate deadlines, make progress visible). For knowledge workers, the procrastination equation provides: a diagnostic framework for understanding specific procrastination, and targeted strategies based on which factors are problematic.",
