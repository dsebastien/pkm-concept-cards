    "summary": "The range of ideas considered politically acceptable at a given time.",
    "explanation": "The Overton Window describes the range of ideas the public considers acceptable in a given society at a given time. Ideas inside the window are mainstream; those outside are seen as radical. The window can shift over time as culture evolves. Understanding the Overton Window helps in communication - ideas just outside the window can gradually be moved in, while those far outside need stepping stones. It explains why radical ideas today may become common sense tomorrow.",
