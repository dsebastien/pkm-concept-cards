    "explanation": "Dharma is a multifaceted Sanskrit term central to Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain thought, meaning natural order, cosmic law, duty, righteousness, and truth. In Hinduism, dharma refers to: cosmic order (rita), religious duty, moral law, and one's proper role and conduct based on caste and life stage (svadharma). In Buddhism, dharma refers to: the Buddha's teachings, natural law, and the nature of reality. Common meanings across traditions include: what is right and proper, the natural way things work, and one's path or purpose. Dharma provides: framework for ethical decision-making, sense of purpose and role, and connection to something larger than self. Living according to dharma involves: understanding your nature and role, acting appropriately in each situation, and aligning with cosmic order. For knowledge workers, dharma suggests: finding your proper work and role, acting ethically within that role, and understanding your professional duties and responsibilities as part of a larger order.",
