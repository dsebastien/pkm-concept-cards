    "summary": "Having deep expertise in one area combined with broad knowledge across multiple fields.",
    "explanation": "T-shaped skills describe a professional profile where someone has deep expertise in one specialty (the vertical bar of the T) combined with broad knowledge across multiple disciplines (the horizontal bar). This contrasts with I-shaped specialists who only have depth, or generalists who only have breadth. The T-shape enables professionals to excel in their core domain while effectively collaborating with experts from other fields, bridging communication gaps, and making unexpected connections. For knowledge workers, developing T-shaped skills means maintaining mastery in a primary area while continuously exploring adjacent fields. This approach creates career flexibility, enhances problem-solving through cross-pollination of ideas, and positions individuals as valuable connectors within organizations.",
