    "summary": "A Latin motto meaning 'take nobody's word for it' - the principle of figuring things out for yourself rather than accepting claims on authority alone.",
    "explanation": "Nullius in verba is a Latin phrase that translates roughly to 'on the word of no one' or 'take nobody's word for it.' It embodies the principle that you should figure things out for yourself rather than simply accepting what others say.\n\n**Historical significance:**\n\nThis phrase is the motto of the Royal Society, the world's oldest independent scientific academy founded in 1660. It represents the fundamental scientific principle that claims should be verified through evidence and experimentation, not accepted merely because an authority figure made them.\n\n**Core meaning:**\n\nThe principle encourages:\n- Independent verification of claims\n- Skepticism toward unsubstantiated assertions\n- Evidence-based thinking\n- Personal investigation and discovery\n- Resistance to blind trust in authority\n\n**Modern applications:**\n\n- **Critical thinking**: Question sources, verify facts, seek evidence\n- **Learning**: Don't just memorize - understand and verify\n- **Research**: Replicate findings, check primary sources\n- **Decision making**: Gather your own data before deciding\n- **PKM**: Verify information before adding it to your knowledge base\n\n**Balance with trust:**\n\nWhile the principle promotes healthy skepticism, it doesn't mean distrusting everything. Rather, it's about not accepting claims solely on authority - especially important claims deserve verification. Trust should be earned through demonstrated reliability, not assumed from position or title.\n\nIn an age of misinformation, this centuries-old principle remains remarkably relevant: figure it out for yourself.",
