    "summary": "When AI models generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or fabricated information.",
    "explanation": "AI hallucination refers to when language models generate plausible-sounding but incorrect, fabricated, or nonsensical information. The model may state false facts confidently, invent citations that don't exist, or make up details when it lacks information. Why it happens: LLMs are trained to produce fluent, contextually appropriate text - not to verify truth. They generate statistically likely continuations, which may be wrong. Hallucinations are a fundamental property of how these models work, not a bug to be fixed. Types of hallucinations: factual errors (wrong dates, events), fabricated sources (fake citations, non-existent papers), confident uncertainty (asserting without knowledge), and conflation (mixing up similar entities). Mitigation strategies: verify AI outputs independently, use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ask for sources and check them, use lower temperature settings, and prompt for acknowledgment of uncertainty. For high-stakes applications: always verify, use AI as first draft not final answer, and maintain human oversight. For knowledge workers, understanding hallucinations is critical: AI outputs need verification, confident tone doesn't indicate accuracy, and healthy skepticism is essential when using AI-generated content.",
