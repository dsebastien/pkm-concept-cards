    "summary": "A mindfulness practice of systematically directing attention through body parts to develop awareness.",
    "explanation": "Body scan meditation is a foundational mindfulness practice where you systematically move attention through different parts of your body, typically from toes to head or vice versa. The goal isn't to change anything but simply to notice sensations - warmth, tension, tingling, numbness, or absence of sensation. Regular practice develops interoception (body awareness), helps identify where you hold stress, and cultivates the skill of directing attention. Body scans are particularly useful for: recognizing stress before it escalates, reconnecting with your body if you live 'in your head,' improving sleep (done lying down), and developing concentration skills that transfer to other meditation practices. Jon Kabat-Zinn made body scans central to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Sessions can range from 5 minutes to 45 minutes depending on thoroughness.",
