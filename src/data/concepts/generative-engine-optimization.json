    "summary": "Optimizing content to be discovered and cited by AI-powered search and chat systems.",
    "explanation": "Generative Engine Optimization is the emerging practice of optimizing content for AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Google's AI Overviews, and Perplexity rather than just traditional search. As users increasingly get answers from AI rather than visiting websites, GEO focuses on: being included in AI training data, being cited in AI-generated responses, and providing authoritative information that AI systems surface. Key strategies include: creating comprehensive, factual content, using clear structures AI can parse, building authority signals that make AI trust your content, and targeting questions AI systems commonly answer. For creators, GEO represents a shift—instead of just ranking in search results, you want AI systems to know, cite, and recommend your content.",
