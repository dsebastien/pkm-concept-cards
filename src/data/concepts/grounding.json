    "summary": "Techniques that bring attention to the present moment and body, reducing overwhelm and anxiety.",
    "explanation": "Grounding is a set of techniques used to bring awareness to the present moment, particularly useful when feeling overwhelmed, anxious, dissociated, or triggered. Grounding works by redirecting attention from distressing thoughts to immediate sensory experience, activating the parasympathetic nervous system and reducing stress response. Common techniques include the 5-4-3-2-1 method (naming 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you feel, 2 you smell, 1 you taste), feeling your feet on the floor, holding a cold object, or doing mental exercises like counting backward. Physical grounding (engaging the body) tends to be more effective during high distress than purely mental techniques. Grounding doesn't solve underlying issues but provides immediate stabilization, creating space for more reflective processing. It's a foundational skill for anxiety management and emotional regulation.",
