    "explanation": "Marginalia refers to the centuries-old practice of writing notes, comments, and annotations in the margins of books and documents. This form of active reading allows readers to engage in a dialogue with the text, capturing immediate reactions, questions, cross-references, and insights. Historical marginalia from scholars, writers, and thinkers provide valuable insights into their thought processes and intellectual history. In modern contexts, marginalia represents a form of personal annotation that bridges reading and note-taking. While digital tools now offer highlighting and commenting features, the tradition of marginalia continues in physical books, serving as a personal layer of meaning added to published works.",
