    "summary": "The skill of accepting, processing, and acting on feedback to accelerate personal growth.",
    "explanation": "Receiving feedback well is a learnable skill that accelerates development. Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen's 'Thanks for the Feedback' identifies three triggers that block feedback: truth triggers (we disagree with content), relationship triggers (we reject based on who's giving it), and identity triggers (feedback threatens our self-image). Receiving feedback well requires: managing initial defensive reactions, separating content from delivery, asking clarifying questions, looking for patterns across multiple sources, and distinguishing between what's true and what's useful. The process involves: genuinely thanking the giver, requesting specifics, taking time to process before responding, and following up on actions taken. Seeking feedback proactively is even more valuable - it demonstrates growth orientation and provides information before problems escalate. For knowledge workers, receiving feedback well creates: faster learning, better relationships, and reputation as someone who grows.",
