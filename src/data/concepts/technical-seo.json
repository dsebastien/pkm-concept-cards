    "explanation": "Technical SEO ensures search engines can access and understand your site. Key areas include: crawlability (can search engines find your pages?), indexability (can they be added to the index?), site speed (Core Web Vitals), mobile-friendliness (responsive design), site architecture (logical URL structure, internal linking), structured data (schema markup), and security (HTTPS). Technical issues can tank rankings regardless of content quality—if Google can't crawl your site, it can't rank it. Common issues include: broken links, duplicate content, slow loading, missing meta tags, and poor mobile experience. For creators, technical SEO often means: choosing a fast, well-coded platform, using proper heading structure, optimizing images, and ensuring mobile responsiveness. Fix technical foundations before focusing on content.",
