    "summary": "Fully accepting reality as it is, without trying to change it or wishing it were different.",
    "explanation": "Radical acceptance, central to Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Buddhist practice, means completely accepting reality as it is in this moment, without judgment, resistance, or attempts to change it. It's not approval, agreement, or resignation, but acknowledgment of what is actually true right now. Suffering often comes from fighting reality - 'This shouldn't be happening' creates additional pain on top of the situation itself. Radical acceptance doesn't mean not working to change things, but accepting the present before taking action. The formula is: Pain + Non-acceptance = Suffering, while Pain + Acceptance = just Pain (which passes). For knowledge workers, radical acceptance helps: process setbacks and failures faster, reduce anxiety about things you can't control, make clearer decisions from reality rather than wishes, and move forward instead of getting stuck in 'if only' thinking.",
