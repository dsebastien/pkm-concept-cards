    "explanation": "The Favorable Principle, inspired by Paulo Coelho's philosophy, encourages paying attention to opportunities in life and following them. Give yourself a chance to attain the success you deserve. When you really want something, the universe conspires in your favor. It's by pursuing opportunities that you will have a chance to realize your dreams. Have faith in your life and destiny. Embrace new paths and remember it's never too late to explore a new direction. Decisions are only the first step - they open doors, but you still have to walk through them to reach your destination.",
