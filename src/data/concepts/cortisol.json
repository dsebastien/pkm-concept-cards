    "summary": "The primary stress hormone that regulates the body's fight-or-flight response and various metabolic processes.",
    "explanation": "Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands, often called the 'stress hormone' because it's released in response to stress and low blood glucose. It plays essential roles in metabolism, immune response, and the body's stress response system. In acute stress, cortisol provides energy, sharpens focus, and prepares the body for action. However, chronic elevated cortisol from prolonged stress leads to serious health problems: impaired memory and cognition, weakened immune function, weight gain, sleep disruption, and increased risk of anxiety and depression. Managing cortisol through stress reduction techniques, adequate sleep, exercise, and mindfulness is crucial for long-term health and cognitive performance.",
