    "summary": "Full attention to the experience of eating - taste, texture, hunger cues, and the act of nourishment.",
    "explanation": "Mindful eating is the practice of bringing full, non-judgmental attention to the experience of eating. Instead of eating while distracted (working, watching TV, scrolling), mindful eating involves: noticing hunger and fullness cues, savoring taste and texture, eating slowly, appreciating where food comes from, and observing emotional states around eating. Benefits include: better recognition of satiety (preventing overeating), greater enjoyment of food, healthier relationship with eating, reduced stress eating, and the meditative benefits of any mindful practice. Techniques include: eating one meal per day without distractions, taking three breaths before eating, putting down utensils between bites, and eating the first few bites with full attention. For knowledge workers who often eat at desks while working, mindful eating provides a break that actually refreshes rather than just fuels.",
