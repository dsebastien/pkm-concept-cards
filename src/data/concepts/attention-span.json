    "summary": "The length of time one can concentrate on a task without becoming distracted.",
    "explanation": "Attention span refers to the duration one can maintain focused concentration on a task before distraction or attention wandering occurs. Claims of decreasing attention spans (often citing 'goldfish' comparisons) are largely unsupported by rigorous research - attention is context-dependent, not fixed. What has changed is: the environment (more competing stimuli), expectations (instant gratification more available), and measurement (we're more aware of distraction). Factors affecting attention span include: task engagement (interesting tasks hold attention longer), external distractions, internal state (fatigue, stress), and practice (attention can be trained). Rather than a fixed capacity, attention span is better understood as: varying by context, improvable through practice, and affected by environmental design. For knowledge workers, understanding attention span means: not treating it as fixed, designing environments that support sustained focus, and recognizing that capacity for attention to important work can be developed.",
