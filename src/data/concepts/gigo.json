    "explanation": "Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO) is the principle that the quality of output is determined by the quality of input. If you consume low-quality information, your knowledge base and thinking will suffer. If you capture without filtering, your system becomes cluttered with noise. This principle emphasizes the importance of careful curation - selecting high-quality sources, filtering what you consume, and being intentional about what enters your PKM system. Quality over quantity.",
