    "summary": "The equilibrium between professional work and personal life activities.",
    "explanation": "Work-Life Balance refers to the equilibrium between time and energy devoted to work versus personal life. While the concept suggests a clear separation, modern knowledge work often blurs these boundaries. Some prefer 'work-life integration' or 'work-life fit' as more realistic framings. Effective PKM can support work-life balance by: reducing work anxiety through externalized memory, enabling more efficient work, and helping track personal goals alongside professional ones. The key is intentionality about boundaries.",
