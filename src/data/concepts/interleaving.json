    "summary": "Mixing different topics or problem types during study sessions.",
    "explanation": "Interleaving is the practice of mixing different topics, subjects, or problem types during study sessions rather than focusing on one thing at a time (blocking). While it feels harder in the moment, interleaving improves long-term learning and the ability to transfer knowledge to new situations. It forces your brain to continually retrieve different strategies, strengthening discrimination and flexible application of knowledge.",
