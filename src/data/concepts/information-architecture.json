    "explanation": "Information Architecture (IA) is the practice of organizing and structuring information at scale to make it findable, usable, and understandable. IA focuses on how information is categorized, labeled, and connected. It applies to websites, applications, knowledge bases, and personal information systems alike. Key IA principles include creating clear navigation, establishing consistent categorization schemes, designing effective search systems, and building logical hierarchies. For PKM practitioners, information architecture principles help design knowledge bases that remain navigable as they grow. IA intersects with Information Management, Knowledge Management, and systems development, providing frameworks for organizing large volumes of information while maintaining accessibility.",
