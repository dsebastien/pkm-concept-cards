  "summary": "Short, intensive periods of maximum concentration on a single task.",
  "explanation": "Focus sprints are short, intensive periods of maximum concentration on a single task - bursts of focused effort with definite endpoints. Unlike longer deep work sessions, sprints are: time-limited (typically 15-60 minutes), single-task (one clear objective), and high-intensity (full engagement). Sprints work well for: overcoming starting resistance, tasks that need concentrated pushes, and building focus capacity. The limited duration makes full engagement more achievable than open-ended sessions. Sprints can be chained with breaks between them, or used as intensive work sessions within larger projects. Key elements: clear objective for the sprint, removal of all distractions, commitment to the full duration, and clean ending. For knowledge workers, focus sprints offer: a lower-commitment entry to deep work, a way to build focus stamina gradually, and an effective tool for tasks that resist starting.",
