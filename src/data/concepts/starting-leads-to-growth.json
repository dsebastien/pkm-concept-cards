    "summary": "The act of starting something small often leads to unexpected growth and larger opportunities over time.",
    "explanation": "Starting Leads to Growth captures the observation that beginning something—even something modest—often creates a chain reaction leading to much larger outcomes than initially imagined.\n\n**The Pattern**:\n\n- Starting a side project leads to building startups\n- Starting a blog leads to writing books\n- Starting to promote yourself leads to getting clients\n- Starting to learn leads to expertise\n- Starting to network leads to partnerships\n\n**Why This Happens**:\n\n1. **Skill development**: The act of doing builds capabilities you didn't have before\n2. **Network effects**: Starting creates connections with others in the space\n3. **Opportunity visibility**: Being active makes opportunities visible that were hidden before\n4. **Compound learning**: Each step teaches lessons that accelerate the next\n5. **Identity shift**: Doing something changes how you see yourself, enabling bigger actions\n\n**The Hidden Path**:\n\nMost successful outcomes weren't visible from the starting point. The blogger didn't plan to become an author—they just started writing. The side project creator didn't plan to become a founder—they just started building. Growth emerges from action, not from planning.\n\n**Implications**:\n\n- **Don't wait for the perfect idea**: Start with what interests you now\n- **Don't demand immediate returns**: Early efforts may not show value until later\n- **Stay curious about where it leads**: Be open to unexpected directions\n- **Document your journey**: Your path may inspire or teach others\n\n**The Courage to Start**:\n\nKnowing that starting leads to growth should lower the barrier to beginning. You don't need to see the entire path—you just need to take the first step. The path reveals itself as you walk it.\n\nThis principle complements 'Start Small' and 'Bias for Action'—it's the 'why' behind the advice to just begin.",
