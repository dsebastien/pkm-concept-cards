    "summary": "The spread of behaviors through social groups, where observing others influences actions.",
    "explanation": "Behavioral contagion is the phenomenon where behaviors spread through social groups - observing others' actions influences our own. This happens through: social proof (if others do it, it must be right), normalization (behaviors become acceptable by being common), and mirror neurons (we unconsciously mimic observed behavior). Research shows contagion effects for: obesity, smoking cessation, happiness, productivity, and charitable giving. Behaviors spread through: direct observation, social networks, and cultural transmission. The strength of contagion depends on: relationship closeness, behavior visibility, and perceived similarity. Contagion can spread: positive behaviors (exercise, healthy eating) and negative ones (procrastination, negativity). Understanding contagion enables: intentional exposure to desired behaviors, avoiding negative behavioral environments, and leveraging social influence for change. For knowledge workers, behavioral contagion suggests: surrounding yourself with productive people, being aware of team behavior patterns, and recognizing that your behaviors affect others in your network.",
