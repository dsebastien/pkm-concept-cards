    "summary": "Retrieving information from memory as a learning technique.",
    "explanation": "Active Recall is the practice of actively retrieving information from memory rather than passively reviewing it. Instead of re-reading notes, you test yourself on the material. This retrieval process strengthens memory traces and improves long-term retention. Combined with spaced repetition, active recall is one of the most effective learning strategies. Tools like flashcards and the Feynman Technique leverage active recall.",
