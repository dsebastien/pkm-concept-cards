    "summary": "Creating new ideas by connecting and recombining existing concepts in novel ways.",
    "explanation": "Combinatorial creativity is the principle that new ideas arise by connecting, combining, and reconfiguring existing ideas rather than from pure originality. As Maria Popova expresses it: 'creativity is combinatorial - it's connecting things, synthesizing.' Innovation typically involves: taking concepts from one domain and applying them elsewhere, combining existing elements in new configurations, or connecting previously unrelated ideas. The implication: creativity depends more on breadth of input and connection-making ability than on mysterious inspiration. Building combinatorial creativity requires: diverse inputs (reading widely, varied experiences), active connection-making (looking for patterns across domains), and environments that enable serendipitous collision of ideas. The concept challenges the myth of the lone genius - most creativity is social and cumulative. For knowledge workers, combinatorial thinking means: valuing diverse knowledge acquisition, maintaining curiosity across domains, and actively seeking connections between disparate ideas.",
