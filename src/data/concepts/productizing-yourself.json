    "summary": "Transforming your unique skills and interests into scalable products that can be infinitely leveraged.",
    "explanation": "Productizing yourself is the process of converting your personal expertise, skills, and interests into products or systems that can generate value without requiring your constant direct involvement. Instead of trading time for money in a linear fashion, you create assets that work for you. This involves identifying what makes you unique, packaging that knowledge or skill into a deliverable format (courses, books, software, templates, etc.), automating as much as possible, and then selling these products repeatedly. The key insight is that once created, these products can be sold infinitely without additional effort proportional to each sale. This approach allows for true scalability and leverage in your career or business, breaking free from the constraints of hourly or salary-based income. It requires shifting from a service mindset to a product mindset, focusing on creating systems rather than performing tasks.",
