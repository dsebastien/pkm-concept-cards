    "explanation": "Differentiated instruction is a teaching philosophy and set of practices that adapt instruction to meet the varied needs of diverse learners. Teachers differentiate based on: student readiness (current skill level), interest (what engages them), and learning profile (how they learn best). Differentiation can occur in: content (what is learned), process (how it's learned), product (how understanding is demonstrated), and environment (the learning setting). Rather than one-size-fits-all instruction, differentiation provides multiple pathways to understanding. Techniques include: tiered assignments, flexible grouping, learning contracts, choice boards, and varied assessment options. For self-directed learners and knowledge workers, differentiation principles suggest: choosing resources that match your current level, using learning methods that work for you, and demonstrating understanding in ways that suit your strengths.",
