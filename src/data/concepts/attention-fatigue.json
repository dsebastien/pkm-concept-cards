    "summary": "The depletion of attentional capacity through sustained directed attention.",
    "explanation": "Attention fatigue (also called directed attention fatigue or mental fatigue) is the depletion of capacity for voluntary attention through extended use. Sustained focus requires cognitive effort, and this effort depletes available resources. Symptoms include: difficulty concentrating, increased distractibility, irritability, and impaired decision-making. Attention fatigue differs from physical tiredness - you can be mentally exhausted while physically rested. Factors accelerating fatigue: prolonged focus, suppressing distractions, emotionally demanding work, and lack of breaks. Recovery requires: restorative environments (especially nature), sleep, activities that engage involuntary attention rather than demanding directed focus, and sufficient breaks. The Kaplan's Attention Restoration Theory specifically addresses recovery from directed attention fatigue. For knowledge workers, managing attention fatigue means: scheduling breaks proactively, using restorative activities (walks, nature), recognizing fatigue before performance degrades significantly, and designing work rhythms that prevent severe depletion.",
