    "summary": "A brief daily team meeting to synchronize work and identify blockers.",
    "explanation": "The Daily Standup (or Daily Scrum) is a time-boxed 15-minute event for the development team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. It's held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.\n\nTraditional format - each team member answers three questions:\n\n1. What did I accomplish yesterday?\n2. What will I work on today?\n3. What obstacles are blocking my progress?\n\nModern variations focus on the work rather than individuals:\n\n- Walking the board (discussing each item from right to left)\n- Focus on blockers and dependencies first\n- Update the sprint burndown\n\nKey characteristics:\n\n1. Time-boxed to 15 minutes - detailed discussions happen afterward\n2. Standing (traditionally) to keep it brief\n3. Same time, same place daily\n4. Development team event (others may observe)\n5. Not a status report to management\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Surfaces blockers early for quick resolution\n- Improves team communication and collaboration\n- Eliminates need for other status meetings\n- Promotes accountability and transparency\n- Keeps sprint goal front of mind\n\nCommon anti-patterns to avoid:\n\n- Reporting to the Scrum Master instead of the team\n- Detailed technical discussions (take offline)\n- Late starts or running over time\n- Treating it as a status meeting for management\n- Skipping when things seem fine\n\nFor remote teams, video standups, async standups (written updates), or walking-the-board formats often work better than the traditional three-question format.",
