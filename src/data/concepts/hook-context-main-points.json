    "explanation": "Hook, Context, Main Points is a content structure pattern: Start with a Hook that grabs attention and creates curiosity. Provide Context to establish relevance and background. Then deliver Main Points - your key insights or takeaways. This structure works for articles, presentations, and videos. The hook earns the reader's attention, context ensures they can follow along, and main points deliver the promised value. It prevents losing readers before the valuable content and ensures clear takeaways.",
