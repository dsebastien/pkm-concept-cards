    "summary": "Establishing expertise and influence through sharing innovative ideas and original perspectives.",
    "explanation": "Thought leadership is the practice of establishing yourself or your organization as an authoritative voice in a particular domain by creating and sharing valuable, original ideas. Thought leaders: identify emerging trends before others, challenge conventional wisdom with evidence, provide frameworks others find useful, and consistently contribute insights that advance the field. Effective thought leadership requires: deep expertise (you must actually know more), original thinking (not just repeating others), consistent sharing (through writing, speaking, etc.), and genuine value to audience (not just self-promotion). Benefits include: career advancement, business development, influence in your field, and personal brand building. Risks include: overextending beyond expertise, becoming more about marketing than substance, and time investment. For knowledge workers, thought leadership offers a path to influence without formal authority, builds professional reputation, and forces continuous learning to stay ahead.",
