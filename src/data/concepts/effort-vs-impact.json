    "name": "Effort vs Impact",
    "summary": "A prioritization matrix that evaluates tasks based on their effort requirements and potential impact.",
    "explanation": "Effort vs Impact is a simple but powerful prioritization framework that evaluates tasks along two dimensions: the effort required and the potential impact. This creates four quadrants: High Impact + Low Effort tasks should be done immediately (quick wins); High Impact + High Effort tasks are your AAA priorities (strategic investments); Low Impact + Low Effort tasks can be done later or delegated; Low Impact + High Effort tasks should typically be avoided entirely. This framework helps you focus your energy on activities that provide the greatest return, similar to but simpler than the Eisenhower Matrix.",
