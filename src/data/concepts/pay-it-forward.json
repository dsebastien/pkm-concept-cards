    "summary": "When someone helps you, you help someone else in return rather than repaying the original helper.",
    "explanation": "Pay It Forward is the concept that when someone helps you, instead of paying them back directly, you help someone else. It's like asymmetric reciprocity - the kindness flows forward rather than back. This creates a chain of generosity that can spread through communities and societies. The concept was popularized by the movie and book of the same name. In knowledge work and PKM communities, paying it forward manifests as sharing knowledge freely, mentoring others, and contributing to open resources that help future learners.",
