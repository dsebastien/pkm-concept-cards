    "summary": "Achieving external goals but feeling empty - success that doesn't bring meaning or satisfaction.",
    "explanation": "Success without fulfillment is the experience of achieving goals - often impressive ones - while feeling empty, unsatisfied, or questioning whether it was worth it. Tony Robbins calls this 'the ultimate failure.' It happens when: success metrics don't align with core values, achievement comes at the cost of relationships or health, external recognition doesn't provide internal validation, or the chase was more meaningful than the achievement. Many high achievers experience this: reaching the summit only to wonder 'is this all there is?' The solution isn't less ambition but more alignment - pursuing success that actually matters to you. This requires: clarifying values before setting goals, including relationships and wellbeing in success definition, and finding meaning in contribution rather than just achievement. For knowledge workers, preventing success-without-fulfillment means regularly asking whether current pursuits will still matter looking back.",
