  "name": "Monkey Mind",
  "summary": "The Buddhist term for an unsettled, restless mind that jumps from thought to thought like a monkey in trees.",
  "explanation": "Monkey mind (kapicitta in Buddhist texts) describes the restless, unsettled quality of the untrained mind - jumping from thought to thought, worry to worry, like a monkey swinging from branch to branch. This constant mental chatter prevents focus, fuels anxiety, and disconnects us from the present moment. The monkey mind isn't inherently bad - it evolved to scan for threats and opportunities - but in modern life it often runs unchecked, generating endless commentary, planning, and worry. Meditation and mindfulness practices aim to calm the monkey, not by suppressing thoughts but by developing a stable awareness that can observe the jumping without being pulled along. For knowledge workers, taming monkey mind is essential for: deep work, clear decision-making, creative insight, and reducing anxiety. The first step is simply noticing the monkey at work.",
