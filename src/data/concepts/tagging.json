    "explanation": "Tagging is the practice of adding keywords or labels to notes for categorization and easier retrieval. Tags are no better or worse than folders, links, or MOCs - they're complementary. When you tag information, don't look for the one perfect tag. Instead, add as many relevant keywords as you can - those are pathways to stumble upon notes later. Tags and metadata enable finding information when you need it, maximizing usefulness and leverage. Each tag you add creates a path to resurface that note in the future.",
