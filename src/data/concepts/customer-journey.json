    "summary": "The complete experience a customer has with your brand, from first awareness to post-purchase.",
    "explanation": "The customer journey maps every touchpoint and interaction someone has with your product or brand. It typically includes stages like Awareness (discovering you exist), Consideration (evaluating options), Decision (making a purchase), Retention (ongoing usage), and Advocacy (recommending to others). Understanding the journey helps identify pain points, optimize experiences, and ensure consistency across channels. For creators and knowledge workers, the journey might flow from social media discovery to email subscription to free content consumption to paid product purchase. Mapping your customer journey reveals opportunities to add value, reduce friction, and build stronger relationships at each stage.",
