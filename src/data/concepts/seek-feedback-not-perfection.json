    "summary": "Prioritize getting real-world feedback over endlessly refining your work.",
    "explanation": "Real-world feedback is invaluable because you cannot predict how people will react to your work, whether it's customers, colleagues, your boss, or anyone else. While quality matters, there's often a point of diminishing returns where further improvements delay release without meaningful benefits. The solution is to ship your work: mark tasks as done, hit publish, share with others. Delays just push feedback further down the road and prevent real progress. Overcome your fear of criticism, put your ego aside, and recognize that feedback is essential for growth. The great thing about feedback is that it enables iteration based on reality, not made-up stories in your head.",
