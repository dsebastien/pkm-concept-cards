    "summary": "Continuing investments due to past costs that cannot be recovered.",
    "explanation": "The Sunk Cost Fallacy is the tendency to continue an endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort) that cannot be recovered, rather than evaluating future costs and benefits. 'I've already put so much into this' becomes justification for continuing even when stopping is rational. In PKM, this might manifest as reluctance to abandon an elaborate system that isn't working or clinging to notes you'll never use just because you spent time creating them.",
