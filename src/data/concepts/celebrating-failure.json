    "name": "Celebrating Failure",
    "summary": "Organizational practices that recognize and reward intelligent failures to promote learning.",
    "explanation": "Celebrating failure refers to organizational practices that recognize and sometimes reward intelligent failures to promote experimentation, learning, and psychological safety. The practice might include: failure awards, public sharing of failure lessons, and recognition for well-executed experiments that didn't succeed. The purpose is to: signal that appropriate risk-taking is valued, reduce fear that inhibits innovation, and extract maximum learning from failures. Effective celebration distinguishes: intelligent failures (worth celebrating) from preventable ones (not worth celebrating), and genuine learning (celebrated) from carelessness (not celebrated). Critics note risks: performative celebration without real change, celebrating all failures indiscriminately, and confusing failure celebration with failure seeking. Authentic celebration involves: genuine appreciation for learning, focus on process quality not just outcomes, and systematic improvement based on lessons. For knowledge workers, celebrating failure means: sharing failure lessons with colleagues, recognizing others who took smart risks, and contributing to environments where appropriate experimentation is encouraged.",
