    "summary": "A framework showing that successful change requires vision, skills, incentives, resources, and an action plan working together.",
    "explanation": "The Lippitt-Knoster Change Model (also known as the Vision Skills Incentives Resources Action Plan model) illustrates the essential components needed for successful change. When all five elements are present - Vision, Skills, Incentives, Resources, and Action Plan - the result is successful change. However, when any element is missing, specific problems arise: Without Vision, there is Confusion; Without Skills, there is Anxiety; Without Incentives, there is Resistance; Without Resources, there is Frustration; Without an Action Plan, there is a Treadmill effect (activity without progress). This framework helps diagnose why change initiatives fail and what elements need to be addressed.",
