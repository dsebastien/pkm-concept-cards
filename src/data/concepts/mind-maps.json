    "summary": "Visual diagrams for organizing information hierarchically from a central topic.",
    "explanation": "Mind Maps are radial visual diagrams for organizing information hierarchically, starting from a central topic and branching out with related ideas. Created by Tony Buzan, they leverage visual thinking and the brain's natural tendency for association. Mind maps are useful for brainstorming, note-taking during lectures, project planning, and exploring connections between ideas. They represent radiant thinking - the non-linear thinking pattern that radiates from a central concept through associations in multiple directions.",
