    "summary": "A visual brainstorming tool for exploring the cascading consequences of a change or decision.",
    "explanation": "The Futures Wheel is a structured brainstorming method for identifying potential consequences of trends or decisions. You place the central change in the middle, then radiate first-order consequences, then second-order consequences from each of those, and so on. This reveals indirect effects that might otherwise be missed. For strategic thinking and decision-making, it helps anticipate unintended consequences and identify opportunities. It's particularly valuable when considering major life or system changes.",
