    "summary": "Prioritizing choices that increase your happiness over career advancement or status.",
    "explanation": "Optimizing for happiness means prioritizing choices that have a higher chance of making you happy, before devoting time and energy to productivity and progress toward external goals. It sometimes means choosing to go slower, changing plans, and making tough decisions. It means focusing on yourself, your well-being, and your loved ones first, rather than what society pressures you to believe is important. Life needs both stability (circles) and direction (lines) - when combined, you find balance and equilibrium where joy and happiness reside. The goal is not at the end but on the path. Trust your gut and focus on making the journey joyful.",
