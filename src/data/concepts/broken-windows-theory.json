    "summary": "Small signs of disorder lead to more disorder if not addressed.",
    "explanation": "Broken Windows Theory suggests that visible signs of disorder and neglect (like broken windows) encourage further disorder and more serious problems. In PKM, this means that a messy, disorganized knowledge base tends to become messier over time. Maintaining basic order and addressing small issues promptly prevents degradation. However, don't let perfectionism prevent you from using your system - some messiness is acceptable. Balance maintenance with actual use.",
