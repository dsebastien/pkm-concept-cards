    "summary": "Winning increases testosterone and confidence, improving chances of winning again.",
    "explanation": "The winner effect, researched by Ian Robertson, describes how winning increases testosterone levels, which in turn increases confidence, risk-tolerance, and likelihood of future wins. It's a positive feedback loop: success breeds success. The effect has been observed across species and contexts - from animal territory fights to human competitions. Neurologically, winning activates reward circuits and changes the brain in ways that improve future performance. However, the winner effect has a dark side: it can lead to overconfidence, excessive risk-taking, and eventual catastrophic losses (as seen in financial bubbles). For knowledge workers, understanding the winner effect suggests: building on small wins to create momentum, being aware of how success can distort judgment, and recognizing that confidence itself is a performance enhancer worth cultivating deliberately.",
