    "summary": "Positive stress that motivates, focuses energy, and improves performance.",
    "explanation": "Eustress (from Greek 'eu' meaning good) is positive stress that feels exciting rather than threatening. Coined by endocrinologist Hans Selye, it describes stress that enhances function, is short-term, and feels within our coping abilities. Examples include: starting a new job, preparing for a performance, learning a challenging skill, or meeting an exciting deadline. Eustress triggers the same physiological responses as distress (increased heart rate, cortisol release) but is interpreted differently by the brain - as challenge rather than threat. Key characteristics: it's perceived as within coping abilities, feels exciting rather than threatening, improves performance and focus, and is typically short-term. For knowledge workers, reframing stress as eustress when possible (seeing challenges as growth opportunities) can transform the experience from depleting to energizing.",
