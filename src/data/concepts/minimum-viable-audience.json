    "explanation": "Minimum Viable Audience (MVA), popularized by Seth Godin, asks: 'What's the smallest audience that could support what you want to do?' This constraint forces focus. Instead of trying to please everyone (and pleasing no one), you identify a specific group whose needs you can serve exceptionally well. MVA thinking leads to: clearer positioning (who exactly is this for?), better products (deeply serving specific needs), and sustainable economics (enough people paying enough money). The audience grows from there—serve the minimum well, and word spreads. For creators, MVA prevents the trap of chasing vanity metrics. It's not about reaching millions; it's about reaching the right people deeply enough to sustain your work.",
