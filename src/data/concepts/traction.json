    "summary": "Actions that pull us toward achieving our goals, the opposite of distraction.",
    "explanation": "Traction is anything that brings us closer to achieving our goals. It's the opposite of distraction, which pulls us away from what matters. While distraction takes us off course, traction pulls us in the right direction. Understanding this polarity helps reframe productivity: instead of just fighting distractions, we can actively cultivate traction by clarifying our goals and aligning our actions with them. Scheduling time for important work, creating rituals, and designing environments that support focus all build traction.",
