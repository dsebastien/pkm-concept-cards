    "summary": "A framework for exploring ideas in four directions: North, South, East, West.",
    "explanation": "The Idea Compass is a framework for exploring and developing ideas by considering four directions. North: Where does this idea come from? What's its origin or higher abstraction? South: Where does this lead? What are the implications? East: What's similar? What analogies exist? West: What's opposite? What contrasts or tensions exist? This systematic exploration helps develop ideas more thoroughly and discover unexpected connections. It's particularly useful when creating permanent notes from fleeting observations.",
