    "summary": "Acknowledging failure without excessive self-criticism while maintaining motivation to improve.",
    "explanation": "Failure acceptance is the practice of acknowledging failure without excessive self-criticism while maintaining motivation to learn and improve. Unlike denial (pretending failure didn't happen) or rumination (obsessing over failure), acceptance involves: recognizing reality, processing emotions appropriately, and moving forward constructively. The practice draws from: self-compassion research (treating yourself kindly after failure), ACT therapy (accepting difficult experiences while committed to values), and growth mindset (failure as learning opportunity). Acceptance is not: resignation (giving up on improvement), approval (thinking failure is good), or suppression (ignoring the emotional impact). The process involves: acknowledging what happened, allowing emotional response, avoiding harsh self-judgment, extracting lessons, and recommitting to goals. Failure acceptance protects against: shame spirals, learned helplessness, and fear-based risk avoidance. It enables: faster recovery, clearer thinking about causes, and sustained motivation. For knowledge workers, failure acceptance means: processing setbacks without catastrophizing, maintaining self-worth separate from performance, and using failures as information rather than identity.",
