    "explanation": "Meta-Learning is the practice of learning how to learn - understanding your own learning process and optimizing it. It involves knowing which strategies work best for different types of material, recognizing when you're not understanding, and adjusting approaches accordingly. Meta-learning is the missing link in education that schools often don't teach. Developing meta-learning skills accelerates all other learning. PKM systems support meta-learning by making the learning process visible and reflectable.",
