    "explanation": "Pillar Pieces (or Pillar Content) are comprehensive, in-depth pieces of content that serve as authoritative references on a topic. Unlike short-form content, pillar pieces aim to be definitive resources that readers bookmark and return to. They typically combine multiple atomic ideas, examples, and practical advice into a cohesive whole. For content creators, pillar pieces establish expertise, attract organic traffic, and provide material to repurpose into smaller pieces. They're the 'evergreen' content that continues providing value for years.",
