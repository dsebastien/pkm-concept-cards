    "summary": "Recommending complementary or related products to customers based on their current purchase.",
    "explanation": "Cross-selling increases revenue by suggesting products that complement what customers are already buying. Amazon's 'Frequently bought together' and 'Customers who bought this also bought' are classic examples. Effective cross-selling requires understanding which products naturally go together and timing recommendations appropriately—during checkout, post-purchase follow-up, or when usage patterns suggest a need. The key is relevance: suggestions should genuinely enhance the customer's experience, not feel like random promotions. For creators and knowledge workers, cross-selling might mean recommending a template pack with a course, a community membership with a book, or consulting services with a digital product. Done well, it serves customers while increasing lifetime value.",
