    "summary": "Visual diagrams showing relationships between concepts.",
    "explanation": "Concept Maps are visual diagrams that show relationships between concepts using nodes (concepts) and labeled links (relationships). Unlike mind maps which are hierarchical, concept maps are network-based and show cross-links between different branches. They consist of one main active (focus) concept map and secondary ones. The 'aha moment' occurs when new associations are created between different concept maps. They're powerful for understanding complex topics, identifying gaps in knowledge, and seeing the big picture of how ideas relate to each other. This mirrors how knowledge exists as a network of interconnected ideas.",
