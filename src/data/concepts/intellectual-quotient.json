    "summary": "A measure of cognitive ability and problem-solving skills, often called raw intelligence.",
    "explanation": "The Intellectual Quotient (IQ) is a standardized measure of human cognitive ability and problem-solving skills. IQ tests assess various cognitive functions including logical reasoning, abstract thinking, pattern recognition, and verbal comprehension. While IQ has been historically valued as the primary measure of intelligence, modern understanding recognizes it as just one dimension of human capability. Research suggests that IQ alone is not a reliable predictor of life success, with factors like Emotional Intelligence (EQ), motivation, and social skills playing equally important or greater roles. The concept of IQ is complemented by the Theory of Multiple Intelligences, which proposes that intelligence manifests in various distinct forms beyond what traditional IQ tests measure.",
