    "summary": "The distinction between capturing external information and creating your own knowledge.",
    "explanation": "Note-taking is about capturing information from the outside world - lectures, books, articles, conversations. Note-making is about expressing yourself - your thoughts, ideas, interpretations, and creations. Both are complementary and valuable. Note-taking is all about capturing information, while note-making is about expressing ourselves. When you are learning, note-taking helps capture what matters. When you are expressing yourself, note-making is the way. Understanding this distinction helps you approach each appropriately.",
