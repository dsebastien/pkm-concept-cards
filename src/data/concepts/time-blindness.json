    "summary": "Difficulty perceiving time accurately, common in ADHD and affecting planning.",
    "explanation": "Time Blindness is the difficulty in perceiving time accurately - either how much time has passed or how long tasks will take. Common in people with ADHD, it affects planning, punctuality, and task estimation. Time seems to move unpredictably - sometimes racing, sometimes crawling. Tools to combat time blindness include: visual timers (Time Timer), time blocking, external cues, breaking tasks into smaller chunks, and building buffer time into schedules. PKM systems can help by externalizing time-related decisions.",
