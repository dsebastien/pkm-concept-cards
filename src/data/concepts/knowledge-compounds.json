    "summary": "Like compound interest, knowledge grows exponentially as ideas connect and build upon each other—but only with a system.",
    "explanation": "The principle that 'Knowledge Compounds Over Time' draws a powerful parallel with compound interest in finance. Just as money grows exponentially when interest is reinvested, knowledge accumulates and multiplies when properly managed.\n\n**How knowledge compounds**:\n- Each new piece of knowledge connects to existing knowledge\n- More connections mean more context for understanding new ideas\n- Learning accelerates as you have more to relate new concepts to\n- Ideas cross-pollinate, generating novel insights\n- Past investments in learning pay dividends indefinitely\n\n**The critical requirement: having a system**\nKnowledge only compounds if you have a system to capture, organize, and connect it. Without a personal knowledge management system:\n- Insights are forgotten\n- Connections are never made\n- Ideas remain isolated\n- Learning must start from scratch repeatedly\n\n**The exponential advantage**:\nOver years and decades, someone who systematically captures and connects knowledge will have an enormous advantage over someone who doesn't. Early investments in building a second brain pay off increasingly over time.\n\nThis is why starting a PKM practice early—even imperfectly—is so valuable. The compounding effect means that every note, connection, and insight you capture today will generate returns for years to come.",
