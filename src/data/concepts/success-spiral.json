    "explanation": "A success spiral is a positive feedback loop where success breeds more success. Initial achievements provide: increased confidence, new skills, expanded networks, more resources, and improved reputation - all of which increase probability of future success. The spiral can start small (a small win builds confidence for a slightly bigger challenge) and compound over time. Success spirals explain why early advantages can compound dramatically (the Matthew effect) and why momentum is so powerful. To initiate a success spiral: start with achievable wins, celebrate progress, build on strengths, and maintain momentum through consistent effort. The opposite - a failure spiral - can work similarly, where setbacks reduce confidence and resources. For knowledge workers, deliberately creating success spirals through small wins is a strategic approach to building capability and confidence for larger achievements.",
