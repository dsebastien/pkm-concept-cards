    "summary": "The indirect consequences that result from the immediate outcomes of our decisions and actions.",
    "explanation": "When we think about the potential effects of our decisions and actions, we often fail to think about second-order effects - things that will happen as a result of the immediate consequences. Our focus tends to remain on the obvious and immediate outcomes. For example, a company might reduce staff to cut costs (first-order effect), but fail to anticipate the resulting decrease in morale and productivity among remaining employees (second-order effect). The ability to anticipate these consequences requires a more systems-oriented approach to decision-making. Developing this deeper foresight can dramatically improve the quality of our choices and help us avoid unintended consequences.",
