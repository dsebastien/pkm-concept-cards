    "explanation": "Heutagogy (self-determined learning), developed by Stewart Hase and Chris Kenyon, extends beyond self-directed learning to emphasize capability development for complex, unpredictable environments. While self-directed learning focuses on known competencies with learner control of process, heutagogy addresses unknown future challenges where learners must be capable of learning what they don't yet know they need. Key principles include: double-loop learning (questioning assumptions and context, not just methods), learner agency in defining what and how to learn, holistic development (not just skills but ways of thinking), and capability versus competency (handling novel situations, not just familiar ones). Heutagogy is particularly relevant for knowledge workers facing rapid change and uncertainty, where the specific knowledge needed is unpredictable. It's about developing the meta-skill of being able to learn and adapt to whatever comes.",
