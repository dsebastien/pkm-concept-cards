    "summary": "A visualization exercise to design what your perfect day would look like.",
    "explanation": "Designing your ideal day is a powerful visualization exercise for clarifying what you truly want in life. It involves answering questions like: When would you wake up? What would you be doing? Who would you be with? What would you eat? Where would you be living? This exercise helps bridge the gap between vague aspirations and concrete goals. By defining your ideal day, you create a compass for decision-making and can work backward to identify the changes needed to move closer to that vision.",
