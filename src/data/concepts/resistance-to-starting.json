    "summary": "The psychological barrier that makes beginning tasks more difficult than continuing them.",
    "explanation": "Resistance to starting is the psychological phenomenon where beginning a task feels significantly harder than continuing it once started. This resistance often exceeds the actual difficulty of the work itself. Steven Pressfield calls this force 'Resistance' (capitalized) - an adversary that opposes creative work. Resistance manifests as: procrastination, distraction-seeking, rationalizing delays, and physical discomfort at the thought of starting. The resistance typically: peaks right before beginning, decreases once work starts, and is strongest for important or meaningful work. Understanding resistance helps because: it's predictable (expect it for important work), it's not personal (everyone experiences it), and it's a compass (what you resist may be what matters most). Strategies include: acknowledging resistance without obeying it, making starting as easy as possible, using momentum from easier tasks, and creating external accountability. For knowledge workers, treating resistance as normal rather than as a personal failing helps maintain progress on meaningful work.",
