    "summary": "The stages and workflow of creating written content from idea to finished piece.",
    "explanation": "The writing process encompasses the stages involved in creating written content - from initial idea through planning, drafting, revision, to final publication. Understanding this process helps writers work more effectively and produces better results. Common stages: prewriting (brainstorming, research, outlining), drafting (getting ideas down without perfectionism), revising (improving structure, clarity, and argument), editing (fixing sentences, word choice), and proofreading (catching errors). Key insight: these stages aren't strictly linear - good writing involves cycling back through stages as needed. The process varies by writer and project, but separating stages often helps. Why process matters: trying to do everything at once (generate ideas, write perfectly, edit) creates cognitive overload and writer's block. Separating generation from evaluation makes both easier. Developing your process: experiment with different approaches, notice what works for you, build routines around productive patterns, and adapt process to different writing types. For knowledge workers, understanding the writing process helps: overcome writer's block, produce better quality writing, write more efficiently, and recognize that rough drafts are supposed to be rough.",
