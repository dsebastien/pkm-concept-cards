    "summary": "The framework organizing how a story or piece of content unfolds over time.",
    "explanation": "Narrative structure is the framework organizing how a story or content unfolds - the sequence and arrangement of elements that shape the reader's experience. Good structure guides readers through content in a satisfying, logical way. Classic structures: three-act structure (setup, confrontation, resolution), hero's journey (departure, initiation, return), inverted pyramid (most important first), and problem-solution (establish problem, present solution). Structure elements: opening (hook, establish context), rising action (build tension, develop ideas), climax/key insight (main point), and resolution (conclusion, implications). Choosing structure: match structure to purpose - journalism uses inverted pyramid, stories use narrative arc, tutorials use progressive steps. Structure creates: pacing (how content unfolds), expectations (readers anticipate patterns), and satisfaction (well-structured endings feel complete). Structure problems: buried lede (key point too late), meandering (no clear progression), anticlimax (weak ending), and no structure (random arrangement). For knowledge workers, understanding structure helps: organize complex content, guide readers effectively, and create satisfying documents that accomplish their purpose.",
