    "explanation": "Copywriting is writing designed to sell—to persuade readers to buy, subscribe, click, or take any desired action. Unlike content writing which informs or entertains, copywriting has a specific commercial goal. Core principles include: know your audience deeply, lead with benefits (not features), address objections, create urgency, and include clear calls to action. Good copy speaks to emotions first, then justifies with logic. The AIDA framework (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) structures most effective copy. For knowledge workers and creators, copywriting skills are essential for emails, landing pages, social posts, and course descriptions. Even subtle improvements in headlines or calls to action can dramatically improve conversion rates.",
