    "explanation": "CRM encompasses both strategy (how you manage customer relationships) and technology (software that enables it). CRM systems centralize customer data: contact information, interaction history, purchase records, support tickets, and engagement patterns. This enables: personalized communication, better customer service, sales pipeline management, and data-driven decisions. Key features include contact management, deal tracking, email integration, reporting, and automation. CRM benefits include improved retention, increased sales efficiency, and better customer experiences. For creators and knowledge workers, CRM might mean tracking subscribers, students, or clients—understanding who your best customers are and how to serve them better. Even simple systems like spreadsheets or Notion can serve as lightweight CRMs.",
