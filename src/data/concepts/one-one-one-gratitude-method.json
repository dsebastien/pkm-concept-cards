    "summary": "Daily gratitude practice: 1 person, 1 thing, 1 event to be grateful for.",
    "explanation": "The 1-1-1 Gratitude Method is a simple daily gratitude practice where you identify: 1 person you're grateful for, 1 thing you're grateful for, and 1 event or experience you're grateful for. This structured approach makes gratitude specific rather than vague, and ensures you're acknowledging different aspects of life. The practice takes just a few minutes and can be incorporated into daily journaling or morning/evening routines. Regular gratitude practice is linked to improved wellbeing and life satisfaction.",
