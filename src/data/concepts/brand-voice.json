    "summary": "The consistent personality and tone a brand uses across all communications.",
    "explanation": "Brand voice is how your brand sounds—the personality that comes through in every piece of content. It encompasses tone (formal vs casual, serious vs playful), vocabulary (technical vs accessible, corporate vs conversational), rhythm (short punchy vs flowing), and perspective (authoritative vs peer-level). Effective brand voice is: distinctive (sounds like only you), consistent (recognizable across channels), appropriate (fits your audience and positioning), and authentic (reflects real values). Defining brand voice often uses character traits: 'We sound knowledgeable but never condescending, enthusiastic but not hype-y.' For creators, your voice is a key differentiator—people follow you partly for how you say things, not just what you say. Voice should feel natural, not performed.",
