    "summary": "A set of practices and habits that promote consistent, high-quality sleep.",
    "explanation": "Sleep hygiene refers to the behavioral and environmental practices that promote healthy, restorative sleep. Just as personal hygiene involves habits that maintain physical health, sleep hygiene encompasses the routines and conditions that optimize sleep quality and duration.\n\nKey sleep hygiene practices include:\n\n**Consistent Schedule**: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends, to reinforce the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n**Pre-Sleep Routine**: Establishing a relaxing wind-down routine 30-60 minutes before bed (reading, gentle stretching, meditation) to signal the body it's time to sleep.\n\n**Sleep Environment**: Creating optimal bedroom conditions:\n- Cool temperature (60-67°F / 15-19°C)\n- Dark room (blackout curtains or eye mask)\n- Quiet space (or white noise if needed)\n- Comfortable mattress and bedding\n\n**Light Exposure**:\n- Bright light exposure in the morning (sunlight or 10,000 lux light box)\n- Avoiding blue light 2-3 hours before bed\n- Using red/amber lighting in evening\n\n**Food and Drink Timing**:\n- Finishing last meal 3-4 hours before bed\n- Avoiding caffeine 8-10 hours before sleep\n- Limiting alcohol (disrupts sleep architecture)\n- Avoiding large fluid intake before bed\n\n**Physical Activity**: Regular exercise improves sleep quality, but intense workouts should finish at least 3-4 hours before bedtime.\n\n**Screen Time**: Turning off screens 30-60 minutes before bed to reduce blue light exposure and mental stimulation.\n\n**Bed Association**: Using the bed only for sleep and intimacy, not for work, eating, or entertainment, to strengthen the mental association between bed and sleep.\n\n**Stress Management**: Processing worries earlier in the day rather than in bed, using techniques like journaling or to-do lists.\n\nPoor sleep hygiene contributes to insomnia, reduced cognitive function, mood problems, and various health issues. While individual needs vary, consistent application of sleep hygiene principles typically improves sleep quality within 2-4 weeks. These practices work by aligning behavior with the body's circadian rhythm and natural sleep processes.",
