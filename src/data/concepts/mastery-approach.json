    "summary": "Focusing on learning, improvement, and skill development rather than demonstrating performance.",
    "explanation": "A mastery approach (or mastery orientation) focuses on learning, understanding, and developing competence rather than on demonstrating ability or outperforming others. This contrasts with a performance approach that prioritizes looking capable and avoiding failure. Research on achievement goal theory shows mastery-oriented individuals: seek challenges as learning opportunities, persist longer after setbacks, use more effective learning strategies, and experience more enjoyment and intrinsic motivation. They ask 'how can I learn and improve?' rather than 'how can I prove I'm smart?' The mastery approach is more adaptive for long-term development and wellbeing. For knowledge workers, cultivating a mastery approach means: embracing difficult tasks as growth opportunities, focusing on progress over perfection, and measuring success by learning rather than just outcomes.",
