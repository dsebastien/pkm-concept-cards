    "explanation": "The Triangle of Purpose is a framework for defining the purpose of any project, product, or content. It consists of three essential questions: Who is your target audience? (What audience do you want to create for?), Why does your project/product need to exist? (What makes your thing something that your audience must have?), and What's in it for you? (What will financially and/or energetically sustain you?). All three corners must be addressed for a sustainable endeavor. Missing any corner leads to problems: no audience means no impact, no purpose means no differentiation, and no personal benefit means burnout.",
