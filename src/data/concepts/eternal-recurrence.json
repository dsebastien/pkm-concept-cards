    "summary": "Nietzsche's thought experiment: would you live your life exactly the same, infinitely?",
    "explanation": "Eternal recurrence is Nietzsche's thought experiment and cosmological speculation: what if you were to live your exact life, with every joy and suffering, infinitely many times? The concept functions as: test of life affirmation (can you embrace this life so fully you'd want it eternally?), motivation for meaningful action (live as if each moment recurs eternally), and challenge to live without regret. The 'demon' proposition asks: would you 'gnash your teeth' at this prospect or experience it as 'the greatest weight' become the most divine affirmation? If you would despair at the prospect, something needs changing. If you could embrace it, you've achieved amor fati - love of fate. The concept isn't primarily about metaphysics (whether recurrence is real) but about: relationship to your life, quality of each choice, and ultimate affirmation versus resignation. For knowledge workers, eternal recurrence suggests: living and working so that you'd embrace infinite repetition, making choices you could affirm eternally, and using this test to evaluate life direction.",
