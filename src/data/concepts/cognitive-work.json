    "summary": "Work that primarily involves thinking, analysis, problem-solving, and mental processing.",
    "explanation": "Cognitive work refers to work that primarily involves thinking, analysis, problem-solving, and mental processing rather than physical labor. It encompasses: analytical thinking (breaking down complex problems), creative thinking (generating novel ideas), decision-making (evaluating options and choosing), learning (acquiring new knowledge), and communication (conveying complex ideas). Cognitive work has unique characteristics: it's invisible (outputs not always tangible), it's variable (quality fluctuates), it's demanding (cognitive resources deplete), and it requires conditions (environment affects performance). Effective cognitive work requires: appropriate difficulty levels (not too easy or hard), adequate rest (cognitive resources need replenishment), environmental support (quiet, appropriate tools), and motivation (engagement with the work). Understanding cognitive work helps: design better work practices, create supportive environments, and maintain sustainable performance. For knowledge workers, optimizing cognitive work means: scheduling demanding work for peak energy, managing cognitive load, creating focus-supporting environments, and recovering adequately between intensive periods.",
