    "summary": "80% of effects come from 20% of causes - focus on high-impact activities.",
    "explanation": "The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. A small portion of inputs typically produces the majority of outputs. In productivity, 20% of your efforts likely produce 80% of your results. In PKM, a small percentage of your notes may provide most of your value. This principle helps prioritize: identify and focus on the vital few rather than the trivial many. Don't try to capture everything - focus on what matters most.",
