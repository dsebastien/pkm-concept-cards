    "summary": "Asking 'why' repeatedly to drill down to root causes.",
    "explanation": "The Five Whys Technique is a problem-solving method where you repeatedly ask 'why' (typically five times) to drill down from symptoms to root causes. Originally from Toyota's manufacturing process, it's effective for personal reflection too. When facing a problem or trying to understand your motivations, asking 'why' repeatedly uncovers deeper layers. The technique prevents treating symptoms while ignoring underlying causes and helps identify leverage points for meaningful change.",
