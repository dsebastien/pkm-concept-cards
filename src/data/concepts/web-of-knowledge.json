    "explanation": "A Web of Knowledge is an interconnected network of ideas, concepts, and notes that grows organically through linking. Unlike hierarchical folder structures, a web allows ideas to exist in multiple contexts simultaneously through connections. This mirrors how the human brain works - through associations and relationships rather than rigid categories. The power comes from unexpected connections that emerge over time, leading to insights and creativity. Building a web of knowledge is a core goal of Zettelkasten and modern PKM systems.",
