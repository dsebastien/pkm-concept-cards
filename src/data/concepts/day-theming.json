    "summary": "Assigning specific themes or focus areas to each day of the week to reduce context switching.",
    "explanation": "Day Theming is a time management strategy where you dedicate entire days (or large portions of days) to specific types of work or focus areas. Instead of mixing different types of tasks throughout every day, you batch similar activities together on designated days. For example, you might have 'Meeting Monday' for all your calls and meetings, 'Deep Work Tuesday' for focused creative projects, 'Admin Wednesday' for emails and paperwork, and so on. This approach reduces context switching costs, as your brain doesn't have to constantly shift between different types of thinking. It also makes planning easier since you know what type of work belongs on which day. Day theming is particularly popular among entrepreneurs, executives, and creators who manage multiple projects or roles. Jack Dorsey famously used this technique when running both Twitter and Square simultaneously. The key is choosing themes that match your actual responsibilities and being flexible enough to handle truly urgent matters that can't wait. Day theming works especially well when combined with time blocking within each themed day.",
