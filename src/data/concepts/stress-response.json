    "summary": "The body's automatic physiological and psychological reaction to perceived threats or demands.",
    "explanation": "The stress response, also known as the fight-or-flight response, is the body's automatic reaction to perceived threats. When the brain detects danger (real or imagined), the amygdala triggers the hypothalamus to activate the sympathetic nervous system, releasing adrenaline and cortisol. This causes increased heart rate, rapid breathing, heightened senses, and energy mobilization—preparing the body for immediate action. While essential for survival, this system evolved for acute physical threats, not chronic modern stressors like work pressure or social media. Prolonged activation leads to health problems: impaired immunity, memory issues, anxiety, and burnout. Completing the stress cycle (through physical activity, breathing, social connection, or creative expression) helps discharge the stress response and return to baseline. Understanding this helps us manage stress more effectively.",
