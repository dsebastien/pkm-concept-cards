    "summary": "A content strategy organizing related pages around central pillar content with strategic internal linking.",
    "explanation": "Content clusters (or topic clusters) organize content hierarchically: a pillar page covers a broad topic comprehensively, while cluster content addresses specific subtopics in depth. All cluster pages link to the pillar (and vice versa), creating a tight internal linking structure that signals topical relevance to search engines. For example, a 'Content Marketing' pillar might link to clusters on 'Blog Strategy,' 'Content Distribution,' 'Content Measurement,' etc. Benefits include: clearer site architecture, stronger topical signals, improved crawlability, and better user navigation. For creators, content clusters help plan systematic content coverage—instead of random posts, you build interconnected resources that collectively establish authority and serve readers at different stages of understanding.",
