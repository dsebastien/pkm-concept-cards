  "summary": "The tendency to disproportionately prefer immediate rewards over larger future rewards.",
  "explanation": "Present bias is the tendency to weight immediate outcomes more heavily than future outcomes, leading to choices that favor now over later - even when waiting would be objectively better. It's why we: eat cake instead of dieting, scroll social media instead of working on goals, and spend rather than save. Present bias differs from simple time preference (valuing $100 now over $100 later makes sense) because it's disproportionate and reverses as options approach. We might prefer $120 in 31 days over $100 in 30 days, but choose $100 today over $120 tomorrow - the same one-day delay valued differently depending on proximity. This explains procrastination, undersaving, and other self-control failures. Countermeasures include: commitment devices (making future choices now), reducing friction for desired behaviors, and increasing present-moment awareness of future consequences. For knowledge workers, understanding present bias helps: design systems that work with this tendency, recognize when immediate desires conflict with stated goals, and create structures that protect future interests.",
