    "explanation": "Distraction-free writing involves environments and practices specifically designed to eliminate distractions and support writing flow. This includes: dedicated writing software (minimalist interfaces, full-screen modes), physical environments (quiet spaces, writing retreats), digital discipline (internet blocking, notification silencing), and practice approaches (freewriting, set durations). Popular distraction-free writing tools provide: minimal interfaces, focus modes that hide everything but text, and features that discourage editing while drafting. The approach recognizes that writing is particularly vulnerable to distraction because: generating new content is cognitively demanding, the blank page triggers avoidance, and any distraction provides relief from the difficulty. Distraction-free practices help by: removing escape routes, creating focused containers, and allowing the mind to settle into writing mode. For knowledge workers who write, distraction-free approaches can: significantly increase writing output, improve writing quality through sustained thought, and make writing feel more manageable.",
