    "summary": "Establishing comprehensive expertise on a subject through extensive, interlinked content coverage.",
    "explanation": "Topical authority means becoming the definitive resource on a subject by thoroughly covering all aspects of a topic. Instead of targeting isolated keywords, you create interconnected content that demonstrates deep expertise. Key strategies include: content clusters (pillar pages linked to supporting articles), comprehensive coverage (answering all questions in a topic area), internal linking (connecting related content), and consistent publishing (ongoing coverage vs one-off posts). Search engines increasingly favor sites with demonstrated expertise over thin content across many topics. For creators, building topical authority means choosing a focused niche and going deep rather than broad—becoming the go-to resource for a specific area rather than covering everything superficially.",
