    "explanation": "Shallow work, in Cal Newport's framework, refers to non-cognitively demanding tasks that don't create much new value and can be performed while distracted. Examples include: email, routine meetings, form-filling, basic administrative tasks, and social media. Shallow work is the opposite of deep work, though both are often necessary. The problem isn't shallow work itself but its tendency to: expand to fill available time, fragment attention, and crowd out deep work. Shallow work feels productive (tasks complete, emails sent) but often produces less lasting value than deep work. Newport suggests: tracking the ratio of deep to shallow work, setting shallow work budgets, batching shallow tasks, and protecting deep work from shallow encroachment. For knowledge workers, managing shallow work means: recognizing its necessity without letting it dominate, being honest about what's shallow versus deep, and structuring days to prioritize higher-value work.",
