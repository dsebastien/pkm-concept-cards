  "name": "Price Anchoring",
  "summary": "A pricing psychology technique where the first price shown influences perception of subsequent prices.",
  "explanation": "Price Anchoring is a cognitive bias used in pricing strategy where the first price a customer sees serves as a reference point (anchor) for evaluating all subsequent prices. A high anchor makes other prices seem reasonable by comparison. This is why premium options are often shown first, or why 'was $200, now $99' is effective. Understanding anchoring helps both in pricing your own products and recognizing when you're being influenced by anchors in purchasing decisions.",
