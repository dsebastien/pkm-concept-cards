    "summary": "Unconventional, low-cost marketing tactics that create high impact through creativity and surprise.",
    "explanation": "Guerrilla marketing uses imagination instead of big budgets to create memorable impressions. Named after guerrilla warfare, it emphasizes surprise, creativity, and unconventional approaches. Tactics include: street art and installations, flash mobs, viral stunts, ambient advertising (unexpected placements), and creative use of public spaces. The goal is generating buzz and word-of-mouth with minimal spend. Success requires: deep understanding of your audience, willingness to take calculated risks, and creative execution. Guerrilla campaigns can backfire if they annoy rather than delight, or if they feel inauthentic. For creators with limited budgets, guerrilla thinking means finding creative ways to stand out—unique content formats, surprising collaborations, or unconventional distribution channels.",
