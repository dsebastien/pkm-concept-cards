    "summary": "Everything in its place - preparation before action.",
    "explanation": "Mise-en-place (French for 'putting in place') is the culinary practice of organizing and arranging all ingredients and tools before cooking begins. Applied to knowledge work, it means preparing your environment, having tools ready, and organizing information before diving into a task. Staging your environment beforehand reduces the number of decisions you need to make and minimizes friction during execution. This principle supports deep work and flow.",
