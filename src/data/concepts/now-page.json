    "explanation": "A Now Page is a webpage (typically at /now) that describes what you're currently focused on in your life and work. Unlike an About page (who you are) or a Contact page (how to reach you), a Now page captures your current priorities, projects, and interests. Created by Derek Sivers, it serves both as external communication and personal clarity - updating it forces reflection on whether your activities align with your stated focus. It's a public commitment device.",
