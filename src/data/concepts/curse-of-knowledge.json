    "summary": "The cognitive bias where experts assume others share their knowledge, making it hard to explain things simply.",
    "explanation": "The Curse of Knowledge is a cognitive bias where once we know something, we unconsciously assume others know it too. This makes it difficult for experts to explain their field in simple terms or remember what it was like not to understand a concept. The curse affects teaching, communication, and knowledge sharing. Experts may skip foundational explanations, use jargon without realizing it, or underestimate how long learning takes. For knowledge workers, awareness of this bias is crucial when sharing knowledge, writing documentation, or teaching others. Mitigation strategies include getting feedback from beginners, using analogies, starting from first principles, and regularly practicing explanation. Remember: there are always people to teach and people to learn from.",
