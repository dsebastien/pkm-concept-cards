    "explanation": "Positioning is about owning a specific perception in your target audience's mind. It's not what you do to a product, but what you do to the mind of the prospect. Effective positioning answers: Who is this for? What category does it compete in? What makes it different? Why should customers care? The goal is to be the obvious choice for a specific need. Positioning strategies include: being first (category leader), being different (unique attribute), being specialized (niche focus), or being opposite (counter-positioning against the leader). For creators and knowledge workers, positioning determines how you're perceived—are you the beginner-friendly teacher, the advanced expert, the contrarian voice, or the practical implementer?",
