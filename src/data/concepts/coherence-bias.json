    "name": "Coherence Bias",
    "summary": "The tendency to construct consistent narratives even when reality is more complex.",
    "explanation": "Coherence Bias is our tendency to prefer stories that 'make sense' - where events flow logically and everything fits together. We unconsciously filter out contradictory evidence and fill gaps with plausible explanations. This makes our understanding of history, people, and events seem cleaner than reality. In PKM, coherence bias can lead to oversimplified notes and connections. Combat it by deliberately noting contradictions, complexity, and questions alongside neat conclusions.",
