    "name": "Delegation",
    "summary": "The process of assigning responsibility and authority for tasks to others.",
    "explanation": "Delegation is the management practice of entrusting tasks, responsibilities, and decision-making authority to others. Effective delegation is a critical skill for leaders and a key enabler of team growth and organizational scalability.\n\nWhy delegation matters:\n\n1. Scalability - Leaders can't do everything themselves\n2. Development - Team members grow through increased responsibility\n3. Engagement - Autonomy increases motivation\n4. Focus - Leaders can concentrate on high-leverage activities\n5. Succession - Builds organizational depth and resilience\n\nThe Delegation Spectrum (Management 3.0):\n\n1. Tell - Leader makes decision and communicates it\n2. Sell - Leader makes decision and explains reasoning\n3. Consult - Leader seeks input before deciding\n4. Agree - Leader and delegate decide together\n5. Advise - Leader offers input; delegate decides\n6. Inquire - Delegate decides and informs leader\n7. Delegate - Full authority with no required reporting\n\nWhat to delegate:\n\n- Tasks others can do (even if differently)\n- Routine decisions within established guidelines\n- Development opportunities for team members\n- Work that matches others' strengths or growth goals\n\nWhat NOT to delegate:\n\n- Hiring, firing, and personnel decisions\n- Performance management conversations\n- Crisis situations requiring immediate leadership\n- Confidential or politically sensitive matters\n- Tasks requiring your unique expertise or relationships\n\nEffective delegation requires:\n\n- Clear expectations and success criteria\n- Appropriate authority matching responsibility\n- Sufficient context and resources\n- Agreed check-in points (not micromanagement)\n- Psychological safety to make mistakes\n\nCommon delegation failures:\n\n- Delegating without authority (responsibility without power)\n- Hovering or micromanaging after delegating\n- Taking back work when it gets difficult\n- Delegating only boring tasks, never development opportunities\n- Failing to provide context or success criteria",
