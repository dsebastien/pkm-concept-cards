    "summary": "A mental or physical space where you can relax, recharge, and protect your peace.",
    "explanation": "We all need our own happy place - a mental and/or physical space where we can go to calm down, relax, and recharge ourselves. It's a place where no one else can disrupt our peace and happiness. We need to actively create this happy place for ourselves and protect it. This could be a physical location (a favorite room, nature spot, or coffee shop), a mental practice (meditation, visualization), or an activity that brings joy. Having a happy place is essential for emotional regulation and maintaining wellbeing in a demanding world.",
