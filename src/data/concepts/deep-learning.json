    "explanation": "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep') to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. These deep neural networks can learn to recognize complex patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nDeep neural networks consist of:\n\n1. Input Layer: Receives raw data (images, text, sound, etc.)\n2. Hidden Layers: Multiple intermediate layers that transform data, each learning increasingly abstract representations\n3. Output Layer: Produces the final prediction or classification\n\nEach connection between neurons has a weight that is adjusted during training through a process called backpropagation. The network learns by minimizing the difference between its predictions and the correct answers.\n\nKey Architectures:\n\n- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image and video processing\n- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Handle sequential data like text and time series\n- Transformers: Power modern language models like GPT and BERT\n- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Generate realistic synthetic data\n\nApplications:\n\n- Image and speech recognition\n- Natural language processing\n- Autonomous vehicles\n- Medical diagnosis\n- Game playing (AlphaGo)\n- Content recommendation\n\nDeep learning has driven many recent AI breakthroughs but requires large amounts of data and computational power. It often functions as a 'black box,' making it difficult to interpret how it reaches its conclusions.",
