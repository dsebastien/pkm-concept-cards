  "summary": "Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.",
  "explanation": "Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. If you give yourself a week to complete a two-hour task, it will somehow take a week. This insight supports timeboxing and deadline setting - constraints actually increase productivity rather than limiting it. Without deadlines, tasks can expand indefinitely. Setting artificial constraints on open-ended work prevents endless refinement and ensures progress.",
