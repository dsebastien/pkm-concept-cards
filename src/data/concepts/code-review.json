    "name": "Code Review",
    "summary": "A quality assurance practice where one or more developers examine code written by a peer before it's merged into the codebase.",
    "explanation": "Code Review is a systematic examination of source code by one or more developers other than the author. The practice catches defects, improves code quality, and shares knowledge across the team. Types include: (1) Formal inspections - structured meetings with defined roles, (2) Over-the-shoulder - informal real-time review, (3) Pull request reviews - asynchronous review via version control platforms, (4) Pair programming - continuous real-time review. Effective reviews focus on: logic errors, edge cases, readability, maintainability, security issues, performance concerns, and adherence to standards. Best practices: keep changes small, provide constructive feedback, automate what can be automated (linting, formatting), and focus on learning not criticism. Studies show code review catches 60-90% of defects. Modern tools include GitHub PRs, GitLab MRs, and Gerrit. The practice is fundamental to quality-focused development culture.",
