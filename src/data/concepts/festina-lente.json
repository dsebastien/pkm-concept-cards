    "summary": "The Latin phrase meaning 'make haste slowly' - balancing speed with deliberation.",
    "explanation": "Festina lente (Latin for 'make haste slowly') is an ancient maxim associated with Roman Emperor Augustus, encapsulating the paradoxical wisdom of combining urgency with carefulness. The concept involves: acting promptly but not rashly, maintaining speed without sacrificing quality, and balancing efficiency with effectiveness. The phrase is often symbolized by: a dolphin wrapped around an anchor (speed with stability), a tortoise with a sail (steady with propulsion). The wisdom addresses: the cost of rushing (errors, rework, burnout), the cost of excessive caution (missed opportunities, stagnation), and the optimal balance for sustainable progress. Festina lente applies to: complex projects (need both urgency and care), learning (quick action but methodical mastery), and decisions (timely but thorough). The paradox is productive - holding both urgency and patience creates dynamic tension. For knowledge workers, festina lente means: working efficiently without rushing, delivering quickly without sacrificing quality, and maintaining sustainable pace on important projects.",
