    "summary": "Regular, scheduled journaling practice at daily, weekly, or other intervals.",
    "explanation": "Periodic Journaling is a form of journaling that happens on a regular schedule - typically daily, but can also be weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly. Unlike sporadic journaling when the mood strikes, periodic journaling creates a consistent practice that becomes a supporting system for productivity. It helps track work to be done and work completed, creates a reliable rhythm for reflection, and builds the habit through regularity. The key is finding a frequency that works for you and sticking to it. Many find that daily journaling provides the most benefit, but even weekly journaling is valuable.",
