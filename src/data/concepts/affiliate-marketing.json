    "summary": "A performance-based marketing model where affiliates earn commissions for promoting others' products.",
    "explanation": "Affiliate marketing creates a win-win: businesses get sales through others' audiences, affiliates earn without creating products. Affiliates promote products through content, reviews, emails, or ads, using tracked links that attribute sales. Commission structures vary from percentage of sale to flat fees or recurring payments. Success requires: choosing products aligned with your audience, genuine recommendations (not just chasing commissions), disclosure of affiliate relationships, and driving qualified traffic. For creators, affiliate marketing can monetize recommendations you'd make anyway, diversify revenue beyond your own products, and require less work than product creation. The key is authenticity—promoting only what you truly believe in maintains trust.",
