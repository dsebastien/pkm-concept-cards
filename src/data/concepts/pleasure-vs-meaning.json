    "summary": "The distinction between hedonic happiness (feeling good) and eudaimonic wellbeing (living well).",
    "explanation": "Pleasure vs. meaning represents a fundamental distinction in wellbeing research. Hedonic wellbeing focuses on maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain - feeling good in the moment. Eudaimonic wellbeing focuses on living according to values, pursuing growth, and contributing to something larger - living well over time. These often diverge: parenting, creative struggle, and challenging work can be meaningful without being pleasurable, while entertainment can be pleasurable without contributing to meaning. Research suggests the most fulfilling lives integrate both - experiencing pleasure while also pursuing meaningful goals. Pure pleasure-seeking leads to emptiness; pure meaning-seeking can lead to burnout and joylessness. The balance is personal - some need more hedonic emphasis, others more meaning. For knowledge workers, understanding this distinction helps: make better life design choices, recognize why achievement alone may not satisfy, and intentionally cultivate both dimensions.",
