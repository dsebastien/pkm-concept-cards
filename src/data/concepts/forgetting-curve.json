    "summary": "The exponential decay of memory retention over time.",
    "explanation": "The Forgetting Curve, discovered by Hermann Ebbinghaus, describes how memory retention declines exponentially over time without reinforcement. Within 24 hours, you forget about 70% of new information; within a week, up to 90%. However, each review 'resets' and strengthens the memory, flattening the curve. This is why PKM is valuable - by externalizing knowledge, you don't need to rely on imperfect human memory. Your knowledge base becomes reliable external memory that never forgets.",
