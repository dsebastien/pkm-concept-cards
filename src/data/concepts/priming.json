    "summary": "A cognitive phenomenon where exposure to one stimulus influences the response to a subsequent stimulus, often without conscious awareness.",
    "explanation": "Priming is a cognitive phenomenon in which exposure to one stimulus influences how we perceive, interpret, or respond to subsequent stimuli. This occurs largely outside of conscious awareness, as our minds automatically activate associated concepts, memories, or behaviors based on recent experiences. For example, exposure to words related to elderly stereotypes can cause people to walk more slowly, and seeing the color red can influence perceptions of attractiveness.\n\nThere are several types of priming. Semantic priming involves activation of related concepts (hearing \"doctor\" makes you faster to recognize \"nurse\"). Perceptual priming affects recognition of similar stimuli. Conceptual priming influences how we categorize or interpret information. Behavioral priming affects our actions, as demonstrated in studies where exposure to achievement-related words improved performance on subsequent tasks.\n\nUnderstanding priming has important applications in marketing, education, therapy, and personal development. Advertisers use priming by associating products with positive concepts. Educators can prime students for learning by activating relevant prior knowledge. In personal contexts, deliberately exposing yourself to positive, goal-relevant stimuli can influence subsequent behavior and motivation. However, it's worth noting that some priming effects have faced replication challenges, leading to more nuanced understanding of when and how priming influences behavior.",
