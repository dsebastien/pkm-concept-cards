    "summary": "Different time scales for planning, from daily tasks to lifetime goals.",
    "explanation": "Time Horizons are different time scales used for planning and organizing work, from immediate (today, this week) to long-term (years, decades, lifetime). Effective personal organization aligns activities across horizons - daily tasks should connect to weekly goals, which connect to monthly objectives, which connect to yearly ambitions, which connect to life goals. Different horizons require different thinking modes: tactical for short-term, strategic for long-term. Regular reviews bridge horizons.",
