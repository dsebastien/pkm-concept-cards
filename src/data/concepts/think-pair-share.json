    "summary": "A collaborative learning structure: individual thinking, partner discussion, then class sharing.",
    "explanation": "Think-Pair-Share is a simple but effective collaborative learning strategy with three stages: Think (students consider a question or problem individually for a set time), Pair (students discuss their thoughts with a partner), Share (pairs share insights with the larger group). The structure ensures everyone engages, not just those who immediately raise hands. Benefits include: increased participation, processing time before speaking, reduced anxiety through small-group first, exposure to diverse perspectives, and development of listening skills. The pause for individual thinking is crucial - it prevents extroverts from dominating and gives introverts processing time. For knowledge workers, this structure can improve meetings and problem-solving sessions: individual reflection, paired discussion, then group synthesis produces better outcomes than jumping straight to group discussion.",
