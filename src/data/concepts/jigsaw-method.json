    "summary": "A collaborative learning technique where each student becomes an expert on one piece and teaches others.",
    "explanation": "The jigsaw method, developed by Elliot Aronson, structures collaborative learning so each member of a group becomes an expert on one part of a larger topic, then teaches that part to others. Like a jigsaw puzzle, each piece is essential to complete the whole. The process: divide content into segments, assign each member a segment, have them study and discuss with 'expert groups' (others studying the same segment), then return to home groups where each member teaches their piece. Benefits include: positive interdependence (everyone's contribution matters), individual accountability, deep processing through teaching, exposure to multiple perspectives, and development of communication skills. For knowledge workers, jigsaw principles apply to: dividing research tasks in teams, cross-training specialists, and structuring meetings where different people share different expertise.",
