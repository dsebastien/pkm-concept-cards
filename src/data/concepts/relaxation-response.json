    "summary": "Herbert Benson's term for the physiological opposite of the stress response - deliberate activation of calm.",
    "explanation": "The relaxation response, coined by Dr. Herbert Benson at Harvard in the 1970s, describes a physical state of deep rest that changes the physical and emotional responses to stress. It's the physiological opposite of fight-or-flight: heart rate slows, blood pressure drops, breathing deepens, muscles relax, and the body stops releasing stress hormones. Unlike simply resting or sleeping, the relaxation response is deliberately induced through specific techniques: meditation, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, tai chi, or prayer. Benson identified two essential steps: a mental focusing device (word, phrase, breath) and passive disregard of intrusive thoughts (returning to focus without frustration). Regular practice has documented benefits for hypertension, chronic pain, anxiety, and insomnia. For knowledge workers, building the skill to trigger the relaxation response provides an on-demand tool for managing stress.",
