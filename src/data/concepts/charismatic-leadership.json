    "summary": "Leadership through extraordinary personal qualities that inspire devotion and followership.",
    "explanation": "Charismatic leadership refers to influence based on exceptional personal qualities that inspire admiration and devotion. Charismatic leaders are perceived as extraordinary - possessing vision, confidence, unconventional behavior, and the ability to articulate ideas compellingly. Max Weber first described charismatic authority as distinct from traditional or rational-legal authority. Characteristics include: strong vision articulation, sensitivity to environment, sensitivity to member needs, personal risk-taking, and unconventional behavior. Charismatic leadership can produce: exceptional motivation, rapid organizational change, and intense loyalty. However, risks include: over-reliance on the leader, ethical concerns (charisma can serve any cause), succession problems, and groupthink from uncritical followers. For knowledge workers, understanding charismatic leadership helps: recognize its power and risks, develop some charismatic qualities (especially compelling communication), and maintain critical thinking even around magnetic leaders.",
