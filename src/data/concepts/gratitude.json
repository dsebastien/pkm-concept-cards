    "summary": "The habit of regularly acknowledging and appreciating the positive aspects of life.",
    "explanation": "Practicing daily gratitude helps us stop feeling gloomy about the past. Our brains are wired to remember less happy parts of our lives, but using mindfulness to track the positive has huge long-term benefits. Happiness is not just a transient feeling - it's a state of mind and a muscle we can train. It starts with noticing small things, appreciating them, and remembering them. A gratitude log or journal helps capture these moments. Comparison is poison - each positive moment counts on its own. Small things and events make us feel good every day; we just have to pay more attention.",
