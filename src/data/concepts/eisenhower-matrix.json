    "summary": "A prioritization framework using urgency and importance to categorize tasks.",
    "explanation": "The Eisenhower Matrix (also called Urgent-Important Matrix) is a prioritization framework that categorizes tasks along two dimensions: urgency and importance. This creates four quadrants: Q1 (Urgent & Important) - do immediately; Q2 (Not Urgent & Important) - schedule time for; Q3 (Urgent & Not Important) - delegate if possible; Q4 (Not Urgent & Not Important) - eliminate. The key insight is spending more time in Q2 (strategic, important work) reduces time spent in Q1 (crisis mode).",
