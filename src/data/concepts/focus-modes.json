    "summary": "Different types of concentrated attention suited to various cognitive tasks.",
    "explanation": "Focus modes recognize that different cognitive tasks require different types of concentrated attention. Common modes include: Generative focus (creating new content, writing, designing), Analytical focus (problem-solving, debugging, analysis), Learning focus (absorbing new information, studying), Administrative focus (processing tasks, organizing), and Reflective focus (planning, reviewing, synthesizing). Each mode may benefit from: different environments (noise levels, settings), different durations (some exhaust faster), and different preparation (warm-up activities). Understanding focus modes helps: match tasks to appropriate mental states, design work sessions for specific needs, and recognize when mode-switching is necessary. Some people work better by batching similar-mode tasks together; others need variety. For knowledge workers, recognizing focus modes means: intentionally choosing which mode a session requires, creating conditions that support that mode, and not expecting one approach to work for all focus needs.",
