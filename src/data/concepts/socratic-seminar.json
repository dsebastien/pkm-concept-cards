    "explanation": "A Socratic seminar is a formal, structured discussion method based on Socratic dialogue - exploring ideas through questions rather than debate or lecture. Participants read a common text, then engage in discussion driven by open-ended questions. The leader asks questions to deepen thinking rather than provide answers. Key features: focus on text or shared content, open-ended questions without single 'correct' answers, participants speak to each other (not just the leader), building on others' ideas, and valuing inquiry over winning arguments. Socratic seminars develop: critical thinking, textual analysis, listening skills, articulation of ideas, and comfort with ambiguity. For knowledge workers, Socratic seminar principles improve discussion quality: asking genuine questions, building on others' contributions, and pursuing understanding rather than positioning.",
