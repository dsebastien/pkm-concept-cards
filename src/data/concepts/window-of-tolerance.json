    "summary": "The optimal zone of nervous system arousal where we can function effectively and cope with stress.",
    "explanation": "The window of tolerance, a concept developed by Dan Siegel, describes the optimal zone of arousal where we can experience emotions without becoming overwhelmed. Within this window, we can think clearly, regulate emotions, and respond flexibly to challenges. Above the window (hyperarousal), we experience anxiety, panic, hypervigilance, or anger. Below it (hypoarousal), we feel numb, disconnected, depressed, or frozen. Trauma, chronic stress, and poor sleep narrow the window, making us more easily dysregulated. The goal isn't to avoid stress but to widen the window through practices that build nervous system resilience: mindfulness, grounding techniques, physical exercise, adequate sleep, and therapeutic work when needed. Recognizing your current state (in window, above, or below) helps choose appropriate regulation strategies. For knowledge workers, maintaining a wide window of tolerance supports creative thinking and effective collaboration.",
