    "explanation": "Velocity vs speed distinguishes productive progress from mere activity. In physics: speed is how fast you're moving; velocity is how fast you're moving in a specific direction. For productivity: speed is amount of activity; velocity is rate of progress toward meaningful goals. High speed, low velocity looks like: being very busy but not advancing priorities, lots of motion without progress, and effort without results. High velocity requires: clear direction (knowing what matters), appropriate speed (not too slow, not frenetically fast), and focused effort (energy on the right things). The distinction matters because: activity feels productive (busyness can mask lack of progress), speed is visible (but velocity requires measuring against goals), and optimization differs (speed asks 'how to do more?'; velocity asks 'is this the right thing?'). Increasing velocity involves: clarifying priorities (what direction are we going?), reducing wasted motion (activity not toward goals), and measuring outcomes (not just inputs). For knowledge workers, the velocity vs speed distinction helps: recognize when busyness isn't progress, focus on outcomes over activity, and avoid confusing motion with advancement.",
