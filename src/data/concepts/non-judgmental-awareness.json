    "summary": "Observing experiences without labeling them as good or bad, right or wrong.",
    "explanation": "Non-judgmental awareness is a core attitude in mindfulness practice - observing thoughts, feelings, and sensations without categorizing them as good or bad, without preferring one experience over another. This doesn't mean having no preferences in life, but creating a space between experience and reaction where you can simply notice what is. We typically add layers of judgment automatically: a thought arises and we immediately label it stupid or brilliant, a sensation occurs and we cling or resist. Non-judgmental awareness suspends this automatic evaluation, allowing direct experience before the mind's commentary. Benefits include: reduced suffering from resisting experience, clearer perception of what's actually happening, more freedom to choose responses, and reduced rumination. For knowledge workers, this skill helps observe thinking without getting tangled in it.",
