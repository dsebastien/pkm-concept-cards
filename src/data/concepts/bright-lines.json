    "explanation": "Bright lines are clear, absolute rules that eliminate the need for case-by-case decision-making in the moment. Unlike flexible guidelines, bright lines are non-negotiable: 'I don't drink alcohol' rather than 'I drink moderately.' Bright lines work because: decisions fatigue willpower, ambiguity creates negotiation space, and absolute rules reduce temptation's leverage. Examples include: 'I don't work on Sundays' (vs. 'I try to rest on weekends'), 'I don't check email before 10am,' and 'I always exercise on Tuesdays.' Effective bright lines are: specific (clear when violated), meaningful (worth maintaining), and enforceable (you control compliance). They're particularly useful for: behaviors where moderation is difficult, areas where you've struggled with willpower, and commitments that define identity. Bright lines can become limiting if: too rigid in genuinely exceptional circumstances, or used for every decision (decision fatigue from another source). For knowledge workers, bright lines help: protect deep work time, maintain work-life boundaries, and eliminate decision fatigue around recurring choices.",
