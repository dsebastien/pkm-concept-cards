    "summary": "A simple yet powerful productivity technique: plan 3-5 prioritized tasks each evening and work through them sequentially the next day.",
    "explanation": "The Ivy Lee Method is a straightforward productivity technique developed by efficiency consultant Ivy Lee in 1918. It's remarkably simple but highly effective for maintaining focus and making consistent progress.\n\n**The Method:**\n\nEvery evening before finishing work:\n\n1. **Write down 3-5 things** you plan to get done the next day\n2. **Rank them** from highest to lowest priority\n3. In the morning, **start working on the highest priority task**\n4. **Only move on to task #2** once you've completed the first\n5. **Repeat** until your list is complete\n\n**Why It Works:**\n\n1. **Eliminates decision fatigue**: By deciding priorities the night before, you wake up knowing exactly what to do. No morning deliberation required.\n\n2. **Forces prioritization**: You can't list everything - only 3-5 items. This forces you to identify what truly matters.\n\n3. **Single-tasking**: Working on one task at a time until completion prevents context switching and improves focus.\n\n4. **Evening planning advantage**: Planning when your day's work is fresh in mind produces better priority decisions than morning planning.\n\n5. **Psychological closure**: Ending each day with a clear plan for tomorrow reduces anxiety and provides mental closure.\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n\n- Keep the list short - 3-5 items maximum\n- Put unfinished tasks at the top of tomorrow's list\n- Be realistic about what you can accomplish\n- Combine with time blocking for even better results",
