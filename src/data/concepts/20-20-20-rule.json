    "summary": "Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to reduce eye strain.",
    "explanation": "The 20-20-20 Rule is a simple technique to prevent digital eye strain and computer vision syndrome. Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus your eyes on something at least 20 feet away. This relaxes the eye muscles that tense up during close-up screen work. For knowledge workers who spend hours reading and writing, this rule helps maintain eye health and reduce headaches, blurred vision, and fatigue. Consider setting a timer or using apps that remind you to take these micro-breaks.",
