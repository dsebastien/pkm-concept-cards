    "summary": "A pre-commitment device where you bind your future self to a decision made in a moment of clarity.",
    "explanation": "A Ulysses Contract (also called a Ulysses Pact) is a commitment mechanism where you make a binding decision in advance that restricts your future options, specifically to prevent yourself from making a poor choice later. The name comes from Homer's Odyssey, where Ulysses (Odysseus) ordered his crew to tie him to the mast so he could hear the Sirens' song without being able to steer the ship toward the rocks.\n\n**The principle:**\nWe often make better decisions when we're not in the grip of temptation, fatigue, or emotion. A Ulysses Contract leverages this by locking in a wise decision during a moment of clarity, making it difficult or impossible to deviate when future circumstances might cloud our judgment.\n\n**Examples of Ulysses Contracts:**\n\n1. **Financial**: Automatic retirement contributions, saving apps that make withdrawals difficult, betting money on achieving goals\n\n2. **Health**: Giving your car keys to a friend at a party, pre-scheduling workout sessions with a trainer, meal prepping to avoid unhealthy choices\n\n3. **Productivity**: Website blockers during work hours, leaving your phone in another room, public commitments to deadlines\n\n4. **Relationships**: Pre-agreed cooling-off periods before big decisions, scheduled check-ins with accountability partners\n\n**Characteristics of effective Ulysses Contracts:**\n\n- **Made in advance**: Created during a rational, clear-headed moment\n- **Binding or costly to break**: The commitment has real consequences\n- **Specific**: Clearly defines the behavior and circumstances\n- **Self-aware**: Acknowledges future weakness without judgment\n\n**Psychological basis:**\n\nUlysses Contracts work because they acknowledge the difference between our 'cool' reflective self and our 'hot' impulsive self. By respecting this dual nature, we can design commitments that protect us from our predictable irrationality.",
