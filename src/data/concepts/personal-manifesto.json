    "explanation": "A Personal Manifesto is a written declaration that articulates your core values, personal principles, beliefs, and commitments. It serves as a guiding document for making decisions aligned with who you are and who you want to become. Creating a manifesto requires deep reflection on what matters most to you. Once documented, it provides clarity during difficult decisions and helps maintain integrity between beliefs and actions. It's a living document that evolves as you grow.",
