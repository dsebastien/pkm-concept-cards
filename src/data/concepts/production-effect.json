    "summary": "Speaking information aloud improves memory compared to silent reading.",
    "explanation": "The production effect refers to the memory advantage for information that is spoken aloud compared to information that is read silently. Words you say out loud are remembered better than words you only read. The effect appears to work through distinctiveness - producing speech creates a richer, more distinctive memory trace that includes motor actions, auditory feedback, and unique processing. This complements other 'production' effects like the generation effect (generating answers beats reading them) and writing effects. Practical applications: read important text aloud, explain concepts out loud even to yourself, use text-to-speech strategically, and practice presentations verbally. For knowledge workers, the production effect supports practices like teaching to learn, rubber duck debugging, and verbal rehearsal. It also explains why audiobooks combined with physical books can be powerful.",
