    "summary": "The research-supported relationship between gratitude practice and increased wellbeing.",
    "explanation": "Gratitude and happiness are strongly connected through research-supported mechanisms. Studies consistently find that gratitude practice increases subjective wellbeing, life satisfaction, and positive emotions while decreasing depression and anxiety. The relationship works through: attention shifting (gratitude directs focus to positives), savoring (extending positive experiences through appreciation), reframing (finding positives in difficulties), and social connection (expressed gratitude strengthens relationships). The relationship is: causal (gratitude interventions increase happiness), bidirectional (happier people also practice more gratitude), and dose-dependent (more practice, more benefit, up to a point). Importantly, gratitude works alongside rather than replacing other happiness factors - it's one tool among many. The relationship applies across: ages, cultures, and circumstances, though the specific forms may vary. Challenges include: forcing gratitude when genuinely unhappy (which can backfire) and ignoring real problems in favor of 'being grateful.' For knowledge workers, understanding this connection motivates: consistent gratitude practice, using gratitude during difficult periods, and building appreciation into daily routines.",
