    "summary": "A time management method using focused work intervals with breaks.",
    "explanation": "The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo, is a time management method using 25-minute focused work intervals (pomodoros) separated by 5-minute breaks, with longer breaks after every four pomodoros. The technique helps maintain focus, prevent burnout, and make work more measurable. The timer creates urgency and commitment. Knowing a break is coming makes it easier to resist distractions. The technique is named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a student.",
