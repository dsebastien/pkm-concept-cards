    "summary": "Moving focus between tasks or stimuli, incurring cognitive costs with each transition.",
    "explanation": "Attention switching (or task switching) is moving focus from one task or stimulus to another. While necessary and sometimes beneficial, switching incurs cognitive costs: switch costs (time and mental energy to reorient), attention residue (part of mind still on previous task), and performance decrements (lower quality immediately after switching). Research shows: heavy multitaskers perform worse on attention tests, switch costs accumulate throughout the day, and recovery time after switching can exceed the switch itself. Not all switching is equal - switching between similar tasks costs less than between dissimilar ones, and some individuals switch more efficiently. Strategies to minimize switching costs: batch similar tasks, complete tasks before switching when possible, create clear transitions, and design environments that discourage unnecessary switching. For knowledge workers, understanding attention switching helps: structure work to minimize costly switches, recognize when multitasking is undermining performance, and protect focused periods.",
