    "summary": "The process of establishing yourself as a trusted expert and go-to resource in a specific field.",
    "explanation": "Authority building creates the perception—backed by substance—that you are an expert worth listening to. It differs from personal branding in its focus on expertise depth rather than visibility breadth. Key strategies include: publishing original research or frameworks, consistent content demonstrating expertise, speaking at industry events, appearing on podcasts, earning media coverage, writing books, teaching courses, and getting endorsements from recognized authorities. Authority compounds—each credential makes the next easier to earn. For creators and knowledge workers, authority determines whether people trust your recommendations, pay premium prices, and seek your perspective. The foundation is genuine expertise; authority building makes that expertise visible and credible.",
