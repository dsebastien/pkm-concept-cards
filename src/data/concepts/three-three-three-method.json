    "summary": "A daily structure: 3 hours on one project, 3 shorter tasks, 3 maintenance activities.",
    "explanation": "The 3-3-3 Method is a daily productivity structure: spend 3 hours on your most important project (deep work), complete 3 shorter tasks (30 minutes or less each), and handle 3 maintenance activities (email, admin, etc.). This creates balanced days that advance significant work while handling necessary smaller tasks. The structure prevents both extremes - neither neglecting deep work for busywork nor ignoring essential maintenance while chasing big projects.",
