    "explanation": "Beginner's mind (shoshin in Japanese) is the Zen concept of approaching situations with openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions, regardless of your expertise level. As Shunryu Suzuki wrote, 'In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few.' Expertise can create blind spots - we see what we expect rather than what's there. Beginner's mind means: setting aside assumptions about what you already know, being genuinely curious even about familiar topics, seeing things fresh rather than through the filter of past experience, and being willing to look foolish by asking 'obvious' questions. For knowledge workers, beginner's mind helps: avoid the curse of knowledge, stay innovative in mature fields, learn from unexpected sources, and remain open to having your mind changed. It's not pretending ignorance but maintaining genuine curiosity.",
