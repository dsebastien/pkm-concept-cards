    "summary": "Begin any endeavor with small, manageable steps rather than ambitious leaps, making progress easier and more sustainable.",
    "explanation": "Start Small is the principle that whatever you want to achieve, beginning with small, manageable actions leads to better outcomes than attempting large leaps from the start.\n\n**Why Starting Small Works**:\n\n1. **Lower barrier to entry**: Small actions feel achievable and reduce resistance to beginning\n2. **Quick wins**: Early successes build confidence and motivation\n3. **Reduced risk**: Small experiments fail small, allowing you to learn without catastrophic consequences\n4. **Sustainable momentum**: Small consistent efforts are easier to maintain than sporadic heroic efforts\n5. **Compound growth**: Small starts can grow exponentially over time\n\n**The Psychology**:\n\n- **Less intimidating**: A small first step doesn't trigger the fear response that large commitments do\n- **Success breeds success**: Each small win creates positive reinforcement\n- **Avoids overwhelm**: Breaking big goals into small pieces prevents paralysis\n- **Builds evidence**: Completing small tasks proves to yourself you can do it\n\n**Practical Applications**:\n\n- **Exercise**: Start with 5 minutes, not an hour\n- **Writing**: Start with one paragraph, not a book\n- **Business**: Start with one customer, not a launch campaign\n- **Learning**: Start with one lesson, not a complete curriculum\n- **Habits**: Start with the minimum viable version\n\n**Common Mistakes**:\n\n- Starting too big and burning out\n- Dismissing small starts as 'not enough'\n- Waiting until you can start 'properly'\n- Comparing your small start to others' mature achievements\n\n**The Paradox**:\n\nStarting small often leads to bigger results than starting big. Those who begin with manageable steps tend to persist longer and ultimately achieve more than those who attempt ambitious starts and give up.",
