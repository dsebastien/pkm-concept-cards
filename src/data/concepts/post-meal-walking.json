    "summary": "A brief walk taken shortly after eating that improves blood sugar regulation and digestion.",
    "explanation": "Post-meal walking is the practice of taking a short walk (typically 10-15 minutes) within 15-30 minutes after finishing a meal. This simple habit has significant metabolic and digestive benefits, supported by substantial research evidence.\n\n**Primary Benefits:**\n\n**Blood Sugar Regulation**: Walking after meals significantly improves glucose metabolism:\n- Reduces post-meal blood sugar spikes by 20-30%\n- Increases insulin sensitivity\n- Helps muscles absorb glucose from the bloodstream\n- Particularly effective for preventing Type 2 diabetes\n- Benefits occur even with slow, gentle walking\n\n**Digestive Health**:\n- Stimulates gastric motility (movement of food through digestive system)\n- Reduces bloating and feelings of fullness\n- May prevent acid reflux and heartburn\n- Supports regular bowel movements\n\n**Cardiovascular Benefits**:\n- Lowers triglyceride levels\n- Reduces blood pressure\n- Improves circulation\n- Supports heart health over time\n\n**Practical Implementation:**\n\n**Timing**: Ideally 15-30 minutes after meals, with the strongest effects when walking immediately or within 15 minutes of finishing.\n\n**Duration**: Even 2-5 minutes shows benefits, but 10-15 minutes appears optimal for blood sugar control.\n\n**Intensity**: Light to moderate pace (conversational pace) is sufficient. Vigorous exercise immediately after eating may cause digestive discomfort.\n\n**Frequency**: Most beneficial when done after every meal, though even once daily (especially after the largest meal) provides advantages.\n\n**Research Findings:**\n\nStudies show that short post-meal walks are more effective at controlling blood sugar than a single longer walk at another time of day. The practice is especially valuable for people with insulin resistance, prediabetes, or Type 2 diabetes, but benefits healthy individuals as well.\n\n**Cultural Context:**\n\nMany traditional cultures have incorporated post-meal walking into daily life (the Italian \"passeggiata,\" Spanish \"paseo\"), suggesting intuitive wisdom about this practice's value.\n\nThis habit exemplifies how small, consistent actions can produce significant health benefits without requiring gym memberships, special equipment, or major lifestyle changes.",
