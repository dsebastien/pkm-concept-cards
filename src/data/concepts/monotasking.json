    "summary": "Deliberately focusing on one task at a time rather than attempting multitasking.",
    "explanation": "Monotasking is the deliberate practice of focusing on one task at a time, rejecting the multitasking myth. It involves: committing fully to a single task, completing or reaching a stopping point before switching, and protecting single-task focus from interruption. Monotasking is powerful because: the brain doesn't truly multitask (it rapidly switches), switching has significant costs, and deep engagement requires sustained attention. The practice requires: clear task definition (knowing what you're working on), environmental support (removing other task triggers), and discipline (resisting the urge to switch). Monotasking feels slower initially because it lacks the stimulation of switching, but typically produces better outcomes in less total time. For knowledge workers, practicing monotasking means: questioning every urge to 'quickly check' something else, setting up work sessions for single tasks, and building tolerance for the less stimulating but more productive single-task mode.",
