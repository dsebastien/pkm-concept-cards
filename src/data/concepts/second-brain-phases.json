    "summary": "The five phases of building and using a second brain system, from capture to sharing.",
    "explanation": "The Second Brain Phases, as described by Tiago Forte, outline the complete lifecycle of knowledge in a personal knowledge management system:\n\n**Phase 1: Capture and Store**\nCollect information, knowledge, and ideas from various sources. This includes highlights from reading, insights from conversations, original thoughts, and anything that resonates with you.\n\n**Phase 2: Organize and Access**\nStructure your captured content so it can be easily found when needed. This involves using systems like PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) to categorize information by actionability.\n\n**Phase 3: Process and Analyze**\nReview and distill what you've captured. Extract key insights, connect ideas, and transform raw information into useful knowledge through progressive summarization.\n\n**Phase 4: Create New Information and Knowledge**\nLeverage your accumulated knowledge to generate new ideas, solve problems, and create original content. Your second brain becomes a thinking partner.\n\n**Phase 5: Publish and Share**\nShare your knowledge with others through writing, teaching, or other forms of expression. This completes the cycle and often generates feedback that enriches your system.\n\nThese phases form a continuous cycle, where sharing leads to new captures, and the system grows more valuable over time.",
