    "explanation": "Camera confidence develops through three distinct phases. The first phase is Horrifying - you cringe when you see yourself on screen. The second phase is Abiding - you don't love it but you tolerate it. The third phase is Inspiring - seeing yourself on screen sparks joy. Understanding these phases helps content creators recognize their current stage and know that discomfort is normal and temporary. Most successful video creators have moved through all three phases, proving that camera confidence can be developed with practice.",
