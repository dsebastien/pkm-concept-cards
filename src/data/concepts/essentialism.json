    "summary": "The disciplined pursuit of less but better by focusing on what's truly essential.",
    "explanation": "Essentialism, as defined by Greg McKeown, is the disciplined pursuit of less but better. It's not about how to get more things done; it's about how to get the right things done. Essentialists focus on the vital few and eliminate the trivial many. In PKM, essentialism means: capturing less but higher-quality information, maintaining fewer but well-used notes, choosing fewer tools and mastering them, and focusing on knowledge that serves your actual goals rather than collecting for its own sake.",
