    "summary": "A comprehensive plan for launching a product or entering a market, covering positioning, pricing, channels, and sales approach.",
    "explanation": "A Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy coordinates all activities required to bring a product to customers successfully. Key components include: target market definition (who you're selling to), value proposition (why they should buy), pricing strategy (how you capture value), distribution channels (how customers access the product), sales approach (direct, self-serve, partner), and marketing plan (how you create awareness and demand). GTM strategy also addresses timing, competitive positioning, and success metrics. For creators and knowledge workers, a GTM strategy for a course might cover: target audience, unique angle, pricing tiers, platform choice, launch sequence, and promotional partners. A clear GTM prevents the 'build it and they will come' fallacy.",
