    "summary": "Education focused on demonstrated skills and knowledge rather than time spent in class.",
    "explanation": "Competency-based education (CBE) measures learning by demonstrated competence rather than seat time. Students progress by proving they've mastered skills, regardless of how long it takes. This contrasts with traditional education where everyone moves at the same pace and receives grades reflecting relative performance. CBE defines clear competencies, allows self-paced progression, uses authentic assessments, and awards credentials when competencies are demonstrated. Benefits include: recognition of prior learning, flexibility for working adults, clear expectations, and focus on actual capability. CBE is growing in higher education and corporate training. For knowledge workers, thinking in competencies means: focusing on demonstrable skills, building portfolios of evidence, and recognizing that knowing how long you studied matters less than what you can actually do.",
