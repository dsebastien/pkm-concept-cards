    "summary": "The brain region responsible for executive functions like planning, decision-making, and impulse control.",
    "explanation": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the front part of the brain's frontal lobe, often called the brain's CEO or executive center. It's responsible for higher-order cognitive functions including planning, decision-making, problem-solving, impulse control, working memory, and regulating emotions. The PFC enables us to override automatic impulses, delay gratification, and engage in goal-directed behavior. It's the last brain region to fully develop, not maturing until the mid-20s. The PFC is highly sensitive to stress: elevated cortisol impairs its function, leading to poor decisions and reduced self-control. This explains why we make worse choices when stressed or tired. Supporting PFC function through sleep, stress management, and avoiding decision fatigue is crucial for knowledge work and self-regulation.",
