    "summary": "Having too much information to process effectively.",
    "explanation": "Information Overload occurs when the volume of information available exceeds our capacity to process it effectively. In the digital age, we're bombarded with more content than ever before. Symptoms include difficulty focusing, decision paralysis, anxiety, and superficial engagement with content. PKM is partly a response to information overload - providing systems to filter, organize, and prioritize information. Key strategies include ruthless curation, defining clear information sources, and accepting you can't consume everything.",
