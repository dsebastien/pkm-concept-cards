    "summary": "Riding out cravings or urges mindfully without acting on them, watching them rise and fall like waves.",
    "explanation": "Urge surfing is a mindfulness technique for handling cravings and impulses by observing them without acting. Developed by Alan Marlatt for addiction treatment, it works for any impulse: eating, checking social media, snapping at someone, or giving up on difficult work. The practice: when an urge arises, instead of acting or suppressing, observe it like watching a wave. Notice where it is in your body, its intensity, how it changes. Urges typically peak within 15-30 minutes and naturally subside if not fed. Key insights: urges are temporary (they pass), they won't harm you (discomfort isn't danger), and acting on urges strengthens them while surfing weakens their power over time. For knowledge workers, urge surfing helps: resist distraction during deep work, avoid impulsive communication, manage snacking and checking habits, and build willpower through practice.",
