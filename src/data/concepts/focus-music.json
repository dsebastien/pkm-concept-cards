    "summary": "Audio specifically designed or selected to support concentrated work.",
    "explanation": "Focus music refers to audio chosen or designed to support concentrated work. The relationship between music and focus is nuanced: music can enhance or impair focus depending on the person, task, and music type. General findings: familiar music is less distracting than novel, instrumental is usually better than vocal, consistent tempo and dynamics work better than variable, and personal preference matters significantly. Popular options include: ambient electronic, classical (especially baroque), video game soundtracks (designed for background engagement), and specialized focus playlists. White/brown/pink noise or nature sounds also work for many people. Music may help by: masking distracting environmental sounds, creating consistent auditory environment, serving as focus trigger, and regulating arousal. However, some work (especially language-based) may suffer with any audio. For knowledge workers, finding effective focus music requires: experimentation, matching to task type, and recognizing when silence is better.",
