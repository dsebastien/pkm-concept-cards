    "summary": "Meetings between senior leaders and employees who don't report directly to them.",
    "explanation": "Skip-level meetings are conversations between a manager and employees who are at least two levels below them in the organization - skipping over the direct manager layer. They provide senior leaders with unfiltered insights and give employees face time with leadership.\n\nPurposes of skip-level meetings:\n\n1. Information Flow\n   - Hear perspectives without filtering\n   - Understand ground-level challenges\n   - Detect cultural or process issues early\n   - Validate what you hear from direct reports\n\n2. Relationship Building\n   - Build trust across organizational layers\n   - Make leadership more accessible\n   - Reduce 'us vs them' dynamics\n   - Increase employee engagement\n\n3. Development\n   - Identify high-potential employees\n   - Provide career guidance and mentorship\n   - Offer broader organizational context\n   - Sponsor and advocate for talent\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Regular cadence (monthly or quarterly)\n- Inform the middle manager to avoid surprises\n- Focus on systemic issues, not individual complaints\n- Ask open-ended questions\n- Follow up on insights and commitments\n- Share appropriate context about organizational direction\n\nGood questions for skip-levels:\n\n- What's working well in your team/area?\n- What's frustrating or slowing you down?\n- What would you change if you could?\n- How well do you understand our strategy?\n- What should I know that I might not?\n- How can leadership be more helpful?\n\nPitfalls to avoid:\n\n- Undermining the middle manager\n- Making promises you can't keep\n- Becoming a complaint session\n- Acting on incomplete information without verification\n- Using as backdoor performance management\n\nSkip-levels require trust and transparency. The middle manager should know they happen and ideally see them as a positive part of organizational health, not a threat.",
