    "summary": "The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas and throw away the bad ones.",
    "explanation": "The Pauling Principle, attributed to Nobel Prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling, captures a fundamental truth about creativity and innovation: quality comes from quantity.\n\n**The insight is counterintuitive:**\n\nMost people try to have one great idea. Pauling's approach is different - generate many ideas first, then filter ruthlessly.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n1. **Removes pressure**: When you're not trying to have the perfect idea, creativity flows more freely.\n\n2. **Increases surface area**: More ideas mean more chances of finding a great one.\n\n3. **Allows combination**: Good ideas often emerge from combining or iterating on mediocre ones.\n\n4. **Builds skill**: The practice of generating ideas improves your ideation ability over time.\n\n5. **Reduces attachment**: When you have many ideas, you're less precious about any single one.\n\n**Practical application:**\n\n- Brainstorm without judgment first\n- Aim for quantity before quality\n- Set idea quotas (e.g., 'I'll generate 20 ideas before evaluating any')\n- Create safe spaces for 'bad' ideas\n- Evaluate and filter only after generation is complete\n\nThis principle aligns with brainstorming best practices and the design thinking philosophy of divergent-then-convergent thinking.",
