    "summary": "The situation where switching to a different tool or service becomes prohibitively difficult due to proprietary dependencies.",
    "explanation": "Vendor lock-in occurs when a customer becomes dependent on a vendor's products or services, making it difficult or expensive to switch to an alternative. In knowledge management, this is a critical consideration because your notes may represent decades of accumulated thinking.\n\n**Forms of lock-in in PKM:**\n\n1. **Data formats** - Proprietary file formats that can't be easily exported or converted\n2. **Tools and platforms** - Features that only work within one ecosystem\n3. **Data handling** - APIs or storage methods that restrict data access\n4. **Extensions and plugins** - Customizations that don't transfer to other tools\n\n**How to avoid vendor lock-in:**\n\n- **Use open file formats** - Prefer Markdown, plain text, and open standards over proprietary formats\n- **Favor local-first software** - Tools that store data on your device give you full control\n- **Regular exports** - Periodically export your data to ensure it's portable\n- **Evaluate exit scenarios** - Before adopting a tool, understand how you would migrate away from it\n- **Prefer interoperable tools** - Choose software that plays well with others through standard APIs and formats\n\nThe principle of 'File over app' captures this well: your files should outlive any single application. Tools like Obsidian, which use plain Markdown files, exemplify this approach - even if the tool disappears, your notes remain accessible.",
