    "summary": "A structured sequence of activities to start your day intentionally.",
    "explanation": "A Morning Routine is a structured sequence of activities performed at the start of each day. Good morning routines set the tone for productive, intentional days. Common elements include: exercise, meditation, journaling, planning, and learning. The key is consistency - doing the same things in the same order reduces decision fatigue and creates momentum. Morning routines leverage willpower when it's highest and establish patterns that carry through the day.",
