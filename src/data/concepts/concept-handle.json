    "explanation": "A Concept Handle is a memorable phrase or term that describes a complex and/or abstract idea, making it easier to think about and communicate. Concept handles help amplify vague ideas by creating valuable mental models. Examples include 'Overton window,' 'Prisoner's dilemma,' and 'Lindy effect.'
