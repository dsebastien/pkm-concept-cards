    "explanation": "A Minimum Viable Product is the smallest version of a product that allows you to collect validated learning about customers with minimum effort. Rather than building complete solutions based on assumptions, MVPs test core hypotheses quickly. The goal isn't a 'bad' product but a focused one - just enough to learn whether your solution addresses a real need. For knowledge workers and creators, MVP thinking applies to content, courses, and systems: start with the essential core, get feedback, then iterate.",
