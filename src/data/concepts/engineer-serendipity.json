    "summary": "Deliberately increasing the likelihood of fortunate discoveries through intentional actions and connections.",
    "explanation": "Engineering serendipity is the practice of deliberately creating conditions for lucky breaks and fortunate discoveries. Rather than waiting passively for good things to happen, you actively increase your luck surface area. Key strategies include talking to new people regularly, attending diverse events, sharing your work publicly, and maintaining an active network. By doing so, you increase the chances of meeting like-minded people, finding collaboration opportunities, discovering business prospects, and achieving success. This connects closely to the concept of Luck Surface Area - the more you put yourself out there, the more opportunities you create. Serendipity can be engineered, not just hoped for.",
