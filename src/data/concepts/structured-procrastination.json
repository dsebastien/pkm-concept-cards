    "summary": "Using procrastination productively by working on important tasks while avoiding the most important one.",
    "explanation": "Structured Procrastination is a technique developed by philosopher John Perry that transforms the procrastinator's tendency to avoid difficult tasks into a productivity strategy. The key insight is that procrastinators rarely do nothing - they avoid one task by doing something else.\n\nThe method works by placing a daunting task at the top of your to-do list, then 'procrastinating' on it by completing other valuable tasks lower on the list. While you avoid the top item, you actually accomplish significant work on secondary priorities.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Hierarchy of tasks**: Maintain a list with seemingly crucial items at the top\n2. **Productive avoidance**: While avoiding top tasks, work on lower-priority items\n3. **Task cycling**: As items get completed, new important tasks take their place\n4. **Self-deception element**: The top tasks often turn out to be less urgent than feared\n\n**Why it's effective:**\n\n- Works with procrastination psychology rather than against it\n- Converts avoidance energy into productive output\n- Reduces guilt and anxiety associated with procrastination\n- Still results in meaningful work getting done\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- Requires honest self-awareness about procrastination patterns\n- May not work for truly urgent deadlines\n- Can become an excuse for never tackling important but uncomfortable tasks\n\nJohn Perry won the 2011 Ig Nobel Prize in Literature for this concept, which he first described in a 1996 essay.",
