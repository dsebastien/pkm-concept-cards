    "name": "Notification Fatigue",
    "summary": "Mental exhaustion and desensitization caused by constant digital alerts and interruptions.",
    "explanation": "Notification fatigue is the cognitive and emotional exhaustion from continuous digital interruptions - app alerts, email notifications, social media pings, and system messages. The fatigue develops because: each notification demands attention assessment, frequent interruptions prevent deep work, the brain stays in reactive mode, and eventually all alerts blend into background noise. This creates a paradox where notifications meant to inform become ignored, causing missed important messages alongside dismissed trivial ones. Research shows notifications harm productivity even when ignored - the mere awareness of unread items creates cognitive load. Notification fatigue symptoms include: reflexive device checking, anxiety when disconnected, difficulty concentrating, and failure to respond to genuinely important alerts. For knowledge workers, managing notification fatigue requires: aggressive reduction of notification sources, batching rather than real-time delivery, and rebuilding sensitivity through periods of notification-free work.",
