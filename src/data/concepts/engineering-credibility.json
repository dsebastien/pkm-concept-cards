    "summary": "The strategic process of building trust and authority through three types of credibility: implied (content quality), perceived (external validation), and earned (demonstrated expertise).",
    "explanation": "Credibility can be systematically engineered through three distinct types, each building on the others.\n\n**Implied Credibility**\n\nPeople judge your content first. If you create quality work that resonates, you gain credibility with each piece. Key elements include:\n- Profile picture and bio\n- Production quality\n- Grammar and clarity\n- Organization of ideas\n- Specificity and depth\n\n**Perceived Credibility**\n\nExternal validation signals that influence how others view you:\n- Being featured in major publications\n- Endorsements from credible people\n- Follower count and social proof\n- Achievements and credentials\n- Revenue from your craft\n\n**Earned Credibility**\n\nThe signal of genuine experience - this cannot be bought. People need to see how seriously you play the game through:\n- Consistency and dedication\n- Hard work and quality output\n- How long you've been creating\n- How often and how much you create\n- How your content performs\n- Your production/activity level\n\n**Improving Your Credibility**\n\nStrategies to strengthen your credibility:\n- **Association**: Share stories while surrounded by recognized experts\n- **Context**: Explain why your take is unique\n- **Arguments**: Challenge conventional wisdom; write about what not to do\n- **Reframe**: Present topics in ways that show unique insight\n- **Perception**: Stand out visually and in all dimensions\n\n**Key insight**: Actions speak louder than words. People get hooked by consistency, dedication, and work quality - not fancy titles. And once earned, leverage your credibility proudly everywhere.",
