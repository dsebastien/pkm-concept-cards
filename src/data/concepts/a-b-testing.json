    "explanation": "A/B testing (split testing) is a controlled experiment comparing two variants to measure which produces better results. You show version A to half your audience and version B to the other half, then measure the difference in your target metric. This removes guesswork from optimization decisions. Common A/B tests include headlines, email subject lines, button colors, pricing, layouts, and copy variations. Valid A/B testing requires sufficient sample size, testing one variable at a time, running tests long enough for statistical significance, and having clear success metrics. For creators and knowledge workers, A/B testing applies to content titles, email sequences, landing pages, and product offerings. Let data guide decisions.",
