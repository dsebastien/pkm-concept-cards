    "summary": "Constraints or mechanisms that compel specific behaviors or outcomes.",
    "explanation": "A Forcing Function is any mechanism, commitment, or constraint that compels you to take action or behave in a certain way. Examples include: deadlines (forcing completion), public commitments (forcing follow-through), and physical environment design (forcing behaviors). In PKM, periodic reviews are forcing functions for processing notes. The power of forcing functions is that they remove the need for willpower - the structure itself drives the behavior.",
