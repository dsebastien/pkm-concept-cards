    "summary": "A fundamental design principle identifying the five key ways to organize any information, summarized by the LATCH acronym.",
    "explanation": "The Five Hat Racks is a foundational information architecture principle coined by Richard Saul Wurman. It states that there are only five ways to organize information, which deeply affects how people discover, interpret, understand, and interact with it.\n\nThese five organizing principles are captured in the LATCH acronym:\n\n**L - Location**\nOrganizing by physical or geographic position. Maps, floor plans, and regional breakdowns use this approach.\n\n**A - Alphabet**\nOrganizing alphabetically. Dictionaries, directories, and indexes use this timeless method.\n\n**T - Time**\nOrganizing chronologically. Timelines, histories, and schedules follow this structure.\n\n**C - Category**\nOrganizing by similarity or type. Libraries, stores, and taxonomies use categorical organization.\n\n**H - Hierarchy**\nOrganizing by magnitude, importance, or ranking. Charts showing 'largest to smallest' or 'most to least' use hierarchy.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n\nEvery information design decision falls into one (or a combination) of these categories. Understanding the Five Hat Racks helps you:\n\n- Choose the most appropriate organization for your context\n- Recognize why certain arrangements feel intuitive or confusing\n- Create better information experiences for yourself and others",
