    "summary": "Turn one idea into five content pieces: Teach, Observe, Contrarian, Listicle, Analyze.",
    "explanation": "TOCLA is a content creation framework that helps you multiply your output from a single idea. One idea can generate five distinct pieces of content: Teach (explain how to do something), Observe (share observations and insights), Contrarian (present an opposing or unconventional view), Listicle (break into a numbered list), and Analyze (deep-dive examination). This approach maximizes content output while maintaining consistency around your core themes. It's particularly useful for content creators who want to maintain a regular publishing schedule without constantly needing new ideas.",
