    "summary": "How you define and measure success - the criteria by which you evaluate achievement.",
    "explanation": "Success metrics are the specific, measurable criteria you use to define and evaluate success. Without clear metrics, success becomes vague and unsatisfying - you achieve goals but don't feel successful, or you're successful by others' standards but not your own. Common success metrics include: financial (income, net worth), professional (title, recognition), relational (quality of relationships), impact (contribution to others), and personal (fulfillment, growth, health). The key insight is that success metrics should be consciously chosen, not unconsciously inherited. Inherited metrics often reflect society's or parents' values, not your own. Examining your implicit metrics - what you actually optimize for - can be revealing. For knowledge workers, clarifying success metrics helps: make aligned decisions, recognize actual achievements, and avoid chasing success that won't satisfy.",
