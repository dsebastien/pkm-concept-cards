    "summary": "The sense of emptiness during transitional phases of life - recognizing that these gaps between meaningful stages are themselves important.",
    "explanation": "Sometimes between the important stages of our lives, we feel like we're traversing cosmic voids - vast empty spaces where life seems 'on hold,' waiting for the next big thing.\n\nThis feeling often relates to:\n- Unfinished work or abandoned projects\n- Failed relationships or ventures\n- Transitions between life chapters\n- Periods of uncertainty about direction\n\n**The reframe:**\n\nThe void is just a perception, not reality. Life continues - things evolve, circumstances change, all the time. Even when negative thoughts take over, they're often disconnected from what's actually happening.\n\n**Why the void matters:**\n\nThe void cannot exist in isolation. Just as empty space between galaxies allows us to distinguish them as separate entities, the gaps between 'big' stages of life help define those stages.\n\nWhat feels like void is actually transition. And transitions are as important as the destinations. We might want to skip ahead, but we'd miss important moments.\n\n**How to navigate the void:**\n\n- Practice mindfulness to stay present during transitions\n- Use journaling to remind yourself that life continues unfolding\n- Recognize that growth often happens in these in-between spaces\n- Accept that not every moment needs to feel significant\n\nThe show goes on, regardless of what we think or feel.",
