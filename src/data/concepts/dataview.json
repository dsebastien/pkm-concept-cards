    "summary": "A query engine for treating Obsidian notes as a database.",
    "explanation": "Dataview is an Obsidian plugin that allows you to query your notes as if they were a database. Using a query language, you can create dynamic views, lists, tables, and task trackers from note metadata. This transforms a static vault into a dynamic knowledge system. Use cases include: creating project dashboards, listing all notes with specific tags, tracking reading lists, and generating dynamic MOCs. Dataview makes notes searchable and actionable in powerful ways.",
