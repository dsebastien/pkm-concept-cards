    "explanation": "Morning Pages, from Julia Cameron's 'The Artist's Way,' involves writing three pages of longhand, stream-of-consciousness writing first thing every morning. There's no topic or structure - you write whatever comes to mind. The practice clears mental clutter, surfaces subconscious thoughts, and primes creativity. Morning pages aren't meant to be good writing - they're a brain dump that empties the mind and often reveals insights, worries, or ideas you didn't know you had.",
