    "summary": "The Stoic practice of remembering that death is inevitable, to live more intentionally.",
    "explanation": "Memento Mori (Latin for 'remember you will die') is a Stoic philosophical practice of reflecting on mortality to live more fully in the present. Rather than being morbid, it's a reminder to prioritize what matters, not waste time on trivialities, and act with urgency on important goals. In productivity and PKM context, memento mori helps combat procrastination and perfectionism - if time is limited, why delay important work? It encourages focusing on legacy-building activities like creating lasting knowledge and meaningful connections.",
