    "summary": "Physical and digital spaces designed to support cognitive and information work.",
    "explanation": "Knowledge worker environment refers to physical and digital spaces designed to support cognitive and information work. Unlike manufacturing where environments are designed for physical tasks, knowledge work environments must support: focus (enabling concentration), collaboration (when needed), creativity (stimulating thinking), and wellbeing (sustainable performance). Physical environment factors include: noise levels, lighting, ergonomics, and visual environment. Digital environment factors include: tool accessibility, notification management, and information organization. Key tensions include: open collaboration spaces vs. private focus areas, digital connectivity vs. attention protection, and standardized setups vs. individual preferences. Effective environments are: adaptable (different modes for different work), controlled (worker has agency), and aligned (supporting rather than hindering work). Remote work has highlighted environment importance - workers with poor home environments struggle. For knowledge workers, optimizing environment means: designing spaces that support your work modes, managing digital environment deliberately, and advocating for appropriate organizational environments.",
