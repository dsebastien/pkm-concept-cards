    "summary": "The underlying principles and rationale that make the PARA organizational method effective.",
    "explanation": "The PARA Method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) is built on several key theoretical principles that explain why it works effectively for organizing digital information.\n\nCore Theoretical Foundations:\n\n1. Actionability Spectrum: Information is organized by how actionable it is, not by topic or source. Projects are most actionable, followed by Areas, Resources, and finally Archives.\n\n2. Just-in-Time Organization: Rather than pre-organizing everything, PARA encourages organizing information when needed. This avoids wasted effort categorizing things that may never be used.\n\n3. Project-Centric Thinking: Projects provide the primary lens for organizing information because they represent concrete outcomes with deadlines. This aligns information with action.\n\n4. Separation of Horizons: The four categories represent different time horizons:\n   - Projects: Short-term (days to months)\n   - Areas: Ongoing (indefinite)\n   - Resources: Reference (as needed)\n   - Archives: Past (rarely accessed)\n\n5. Minimal Viable Organization: PARA uses only four top-level categories, reducing cognitive overhead and decision fatigue when filing information.\n\n6. Cross-Tool Consistency: The same structure works across all tools (file system, notes, task manager, cloud storage), creating cognitive consistency.\n\n7. Progressive Disclosure: Information flows through the system - from active projects to archives - based on relevance, keeping active workspaces clean.\n\n8. Outcome Orientation: By organizing around outcomes (projects) rather than topics, PARA naturally surfaces relevant information when it's needed for action.\n\nThe theory emphasizes that organization should serve action, not just storage.",
