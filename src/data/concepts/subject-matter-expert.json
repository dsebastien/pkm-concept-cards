    "explanation": "A Subject-Matter Expert (SME) possesses deep, specialized knowledge in a particular domain. SMEs are valuable for their expertise but can create bottlenecks and bus factor risks if knowledge isn't shared. Developing SME status in an area creates career value but requires continuous learning as fields evolve. For PKM, building a personal knowledge base helps transition from 'expert who knows things' to 'expert who can share knowledge' - making expertise more valuable and transferable.",
