    "summary": "A simple evening journaling practice: 1 win, 1 challenge, 1 gratitude.",
    "explanation": "The 1-1-1 Method is a simple daily journaling practice created by Sahil Bloom. Every evening, write down three things: 1 win for the day (something you accomplished or that went well), 1 challenge, problem, point of tension, stress, or anxiety (acknowledging difficulties), and 1 thing you're grateful for (cultivating gratitude). It's a simple 5-minute practice that provides an incredible return in the form of clarity and peace of mind. The simplicity makes it sustainable - unlike elaborate journaling systems that often get abandoned.",
