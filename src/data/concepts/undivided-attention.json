    "summary": "Giving complete focus to a person or task without multitasking or distraction.",
    "explanation": "Undivided Attention means being fully present - not checking your phone, not thinking about what to say next, not mentally elsewhere. It's increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. In conversations, undivided attention signals respect and enables deeper understanding. For deep work, it enables flow states and quality output. The key insight is that attention cannot truly be divided - we can only switch rapidly between things, losing something each time. Choosing what deserves undivided attention is a critical decision.",
