    "summary": "Physical and digital spaces designed to support concentrated cognitive work.",
    "explanation": "A focus environment is a physical and/or digital space optimized for concentrated cognitive work. Physical elements include: minimal visual clutter, comfortable temperature, appropriate lighting (natural light often preferred), ergonomic setup, and noise management. Digital elements include: distraction blockers, notification management, clean desktop, and focused app configurations. The environment should: minimize interruption triggers, support sustained posture, and signal 'work mode.' Some people need dedicated spaces for focus (home offices, libraries); others create portable environments (headphones, laptop configurations). The key is: consistency builds association between environment and focus. Environment design acknowledges that willpower is limited - it's easier to focus when the environment supports it than to resist environmental distractions. For knowledge workers, optimizing focus environment means: auditing current spaces for distractions, making changes that support focus, and potentially maintaining multiple environments for different work types.",
