    "summary": "A learning model describing the psychological states from unconscious incompetence to unconscious competence.",
    "explanation": "The Four Stages of Competence is a popular psychological learning model that describes the progression we go through when acquiring any new skill. The stages are: (1) Unconscious incompetence - we don't know what we don't know, our view is narrow, and our intuition is often wrong; (2) Conscious incompetence - we begin to realize how much we have yet to learn, and progress requires experimentation and embracing failure; (3) Conscious competence - we can perform tasks independently but still need focused effort and have knowledge gaps; (4) Unconscious competence - the skill becomes second nature, feeling intuitive and effortless. Understanding these stages helps set realistic expectations during learning and explains why initial confidence may be misplaced. This model has a close relationship with the Dunning-Kruger effect, as both deal with self-awareness of one's abilities at different skill levels.",
