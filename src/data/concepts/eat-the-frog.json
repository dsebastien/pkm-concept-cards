    "explanation": "Eat the Frog is a time management and productivity technique popularized by Brian Tracy in his book 'Eat That Frog! 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time.' The concept derives from a quote often attributed to Mark Twain: 'If the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.'\n\nThe 'frog' represents your most challenging, important, or dreaded task - the one you're most likely to procrastinate on. By completing this task first thing in the morning when your willpower and mental energy are at their peak, you:\n\n1. **Eliminate procrastination**: The hardest task is done before resistance builds up\n2. **Build momentum**: Accomplishing something difficult early creates positive momentum for the rest of the day\n3. **Reduce anxiety**: The dreaded task no longer hangs over you\n4. **Ensure important work gets done**: High-priority tasks aren't pushed aside by urgent but less important ones\n5. **Leverage peak energy**: Morning hours typically offer the freshest mental resources\n\nIf you have two 'frogs,' Tracy advises eating the ugliest one first - meaning start with the bigger, harder task. The technique pairs well with identifying your Most Important Task (MIT) and morning routines designed around deep work.",
