    "summary": "Assessing what activities, people, and contexts give versus drain your energy.",
    "explanation": "An energy audit is the practice of systematically assessing what activities, people, and contexts give versus drain your energy. The audit recognizes that: different activities have different energy costs and returns, energy patterns are personal (what energizes one person drains another), and awareness enables better design of days and work. The process involves: tracking energy levels throughout day, noting what preceded energy changes, and identifying patterns over time. Categories often include: energy-giving (leave you feeling more alive), energy-neutral, and energy-draining (leave you depleted). Factors to assess include: specific tasks, types of work, people and interactions, environments, and times of day. The audit enables: scheduling draining activities strategically, ensuring sufficient energy-giving activities, and redesigning work and life for better energy management. Audits can be: daily tracking for a period, retrospective reflection, or ongoing awareness practice. For knowledge workers, energy audits help: optimize schedules, make better role and project choices, and maintain sustainable energy levels.",
