    "explanation": "The generosity principle is the practice of giving freely and abundantly as a foundational approach to relationships and interactions. Unlike calculated reciprocity or strategic networking, true generosity comes from genuine desire to help without expectation of return. The principle operates through: creating positive-sum interactions (lifting everyone), building authentic relationships (connection beyond transaction), and generating unexpected returns (often exceeding what was given). Generosity triggers reciprocity naturally but isn't dependent on it. Research shows generous people experience: greater happiness, stronger relationships, better health outcomes, and often more success. The principle requires: abundance mindset (enough to share), genuine care (not performance), and wisdom (knowing when and how to give). Pitfalls include: self-depletion, enabling dependency, and performative giving. Sustainable generosity requires: boundaries, discernment about recipients, and giving from overflow rather than deficit. For knowledge workers, the generosity principle means: sharing expertise freely, mentoring others, contributing to community, and approaching interactions with 'how can I help?' rather than 'what can I get?'",
