    "name": "Subscription Business Model",
    "summary": "A revenue model where customers pay recurring fees for ongoing access to a product or service.",
    "explanation": "The Subscription Business Model generates recurring revenue through regular payments (monthly, yearly) rather than one-time purchases. This creates predictable income, encourages ongoing value delivery, and builds long-term customer relationships. For creators, subscriptions (newsletters, memberships, communities) provide stability and incentivize continuous improvement. The challenge is maintaining value that justifies ongoing payment and managing churn (customers who cancel).",
