    "summary": "AI systems that create new content such as text, images, audio, or video.",
    "explanation": "Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that create new content - text, images, audio, video, code, or other outputs - rather than simply analyzing or classifying existing content. Unlike traditional AI that answers 'what is this?' generative AI answers 'create something like this.' Types of generative AI: large language models (text generation), image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion), code assistants (GitHub Copilot), audio/music generators, and video synthesis. How they work: trained on massive datasets to learn patterns and distributions, then generate new samples that follow similar patterns. For LLMs, this means predicting likely next tokens; for image models, generating pixels that match text descriptions. Capabilities include: writing assistance, creative ideation, code generation, content creation, summarization, translation, and multimedia synthesis. Limitations: outputs need verification (hallucinations, errors), can perpetuate biases, don't truly 'understand,' and raise copyright/attribution questions. For knowledge workers, generative AI offers: powerful creative assistance, acceleration of content creation, and augmentation of human capabilities - when used with appropriate oversight and verification.",
