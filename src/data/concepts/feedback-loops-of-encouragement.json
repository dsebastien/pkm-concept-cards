    "name": "Feedback Loops of Encouragement and Discouragement",
    "summary": "Early encouragement breeds confidence and success, while discouragement creates risk aversion and reduces confidence.",
    "explanation": "Feedback loops of encouragement and discouragement shape our confidence and success patterns from childhood. If encouraged regularly while growing up, we become more confident in our abilities and tend to succeed more often. If discouraged regularly, we become more risk-averse, much less confident in ourselves, and tend to succeed less. These patterns form virtuous or vicious circles that can persist throughout life. Understanding this helps us be more intentional about the feedback we give others and ourselves, and to actively work on breaking negative patterns.",
