    "summary": "The tradeoff between brevity and providing enough background for understanding.",
    "explanation": "Every communication faces tension between compression (being concise) and context (providing background). Highly compressed messages are efficient for experts but confusing for newcomers. Context-rich messages are accessible but time-consuming. The right balance depends on audience knowledge and communication medium. Effective communicators calibrate this tradeoff, providing enough context for understanding while respecting attention limits. Progressive disclosure - starting compressed with context available on demand - can bridge this tension.",
