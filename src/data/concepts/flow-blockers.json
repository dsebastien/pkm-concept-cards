    "explanation": "Flow blockers are conditions, behaviors, and factors that prevent entering or maintaining flow states. Common blockers include: distractions (notifications, interruptions, noise), anxiety (task too difficult, fear of judgment), boredom (task too easy, unchallenging), unclear goals (not knowing what to do next), lack of feedback (can't tell if you're succeeding), self-consciousness (awareness of self disrupts immersion), and time pressure (wrong kind of pressure undermines flow). Some blockers are environmental (controllable through design); others are psychological (requiring different interventions). Flow is fragile - once disrupted, returning is difficult. Understanding blockers helps: create flow-supporting environments, recognize personal flow vulnerabilities, and address blockers proactively rather than reactively. For knowledge workers, managing flow blockers means: auditing for common blockers, designing environments and practices that minimize them, and recognizing when blocker removal is the most effective flow strategy.",
