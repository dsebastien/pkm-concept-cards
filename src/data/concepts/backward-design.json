    "summary": "Starting curriculum design with desired outcomes, then planning assessment and instruction to achieve them.",
    "explanation": "Backward design, popularized by Wiggins and McTighe in 'Understanding by Design,' reverses traditional curriculum planning. Instead of starting with content and activities, you begin with the end: What should students know and be able to do? Then work backward: How will we know if they learned it (assessment)? What activities will help them get there (instruction)? The three stages are: identify desired results, determine acceptable evidence, and plan learning experiences. This prevents 'coverage' without understanding and ensures alignment between goals, assessment, and instruction. For knowledge workers and self-learners, backward design principles apply to: starting projects with clear success criteria, defining how you'll know you've learned something, and designing practice around actual performance needs rather than just accumulating information.",
