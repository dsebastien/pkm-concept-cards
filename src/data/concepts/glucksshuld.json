    "explanation": "Glucksshuld (German: Glücksschuld) is the guilt one feels at one's own good fortune. It's essentially the inverse of Schadenfreude (pleasure at others' misfortune).\n\nThis emotion manifests in various ways:\n\n**Survivor's guilt**: Feeling bad for having escaped hardship that affected others.\n\n**Success guilt**: Discomfort with achievements when others are struggling.\n\n**Privilege awareness**: The uncomfortable recognition that your advantages are unearned or arbitrary.\n\n**Crisis avoidance guilt**: The ability to choose to ignore various crises when you want to, while knowing others cannot.\n\n**Why understanding Glucksshuld matters:**\n\n1. **Validates a common feeling**: Many successful or fortunate people experience this but don't have a word for it.\n\n2. **Enables healthier processing**: Naming the emotion helps address it constructively.\n\n3. **Informs giving and helping**: Understanding this feeling can motivate positive action rather than paralysis.\n\n4. **Balances perspective**: While some guilt can be healthy, excessive Glucksshuld can prevent enjoying legitimate success.\n\nThe solution isn't to eliminate the feeling but to channel it productively - using your good fortune to help others while also allowing yourself to appreciate what you have.",
