    "summary": "Applying design thinking principles to intentionally create your ideal life.",
    "explanation": "Life Design applies design thinking principles to the challenge of creating a meaningful, fulfilling life. Rather than letting life happen to you, you actively prototype, iterate, and design your path. Key practices include: defining what 'a well-lived life' means to you, generating multiple possible futures, prototyping through small experiments, and iterating based on what you learn. Life Design treats life as a design problem to be solved creatively, not a problem to be optimized.",
