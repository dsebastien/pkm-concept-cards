    "summary": "A relative estimation unit measuring the effort and complexity of user stories.",
    "explanation": "Story points are a unit of measure for expressing the overall effort required to fully implement a product backlog item or user story. Unlike time-based estimates, story points represent relative complexity, risk, and effort.\n\nKey characteristics:\n\n1. Relative, not absolute - Stories are compared to each other, not estimated in hours\n2. Team-specific - A 5-point story for one team may differ from another's\n3. Include all work - Development, testing, documentation, etc.\n4. Account for uncertainty - More complex items get higher points\n\nCommon scales:\n\n- Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...)\n- Modified Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100)\n- T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL) mapped to numbers\n- Powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32)\n\nWhy Fibonacci? The gaps between numbers increase, reflecting that larger items have more uncertainty. You can distinguish 3 from 5, but not 21 from 22.\n\nEstimation techniques:\n\n1. Planning Poker - Team members privately select cards, then reveal and discuss\n2. Affinity Estimation - Group similar items, then assign points to groups\n3. Reference Story - Compare new stories to a well-understood reference\n\nBenefits of story points:\n\n- Faster than detailed hour estimates\n- Encourage team discussion about complexity\n- Reduce anchoring to 'ideal hours'\n- Enable velocity tracking for planning\n- Focus on relative sizing over precision\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n- Converting points to hours (defeats the purpose)\n- Comparing velocity between teams\n- Using for performance evaluation\n- Over-precision (debating 5 vs 6)\n\nStory points feed into velocity calculations, enabling better sprint planning and release forecasting over time.",
