    "explanation": "Jason Fried (Basecamp) recommends not putting too much trust in what we observe elsewhere. What we see, hear, and read about other companies and products is all biased - we only get part of the truth. Things may appear perfect on the outside but be completely flawed on the inside. In reality, everything is nuanced and rarely as awesome as we think. Others do not know everything, and there is always room for our ideas, knowledge, and style. People who write and create do not necessarily know much more than we do. Impressions should not stop us from moving forward with our own ideas and projects. This is an invitation to try, no matter what you think about the competition.",
