    "summary": "Keeping inboxes empty by processing items to appropriate destinations.",
    "explanation": "Inbox Zero is the practice of regularly processing inboxes to empty (or near-empty). The key insight is that inboxes are for receiving, not storing. Each item should be processed to a destination: deleted, delegated, done immediately (if quick), deferred (with a reminder), or filed. The goal isn't zero emails but zero unprocessed items. This principle applies beyond email to any inbox: notes inbox, task inbox, physical inbox. Unprocessed inboxes create stress and hide important items.",
