    "summary": "Focusing completely on one task at a time rather than attempting to multitask.",
    "explanation": "Single-tasking (or monotasking) is the practice of dedicating complete attention to one task until it is finished or until a predetermined time is up. It is the deliberate opposite of multitasking, which research has consistently shown to reduce productivity and increase errors.\n\n**Why single-tasking works:**\n\n- **Cognitive efficiency**: The brain processes information more effectively when focused on one thing\n- **Reduced context-switching costs**: Every task switch incurs a mental 'switching cost' of 15-25 minutes to regain focus\n- **Higher quality output**: Undivided attention produces better work with fewer mistakes\n- **Faster completion**: Paradoxically, doing one thing at a time often results in completing more overall\n\n**How to practice single-tasking:**\n\n1. **Choose one task**: Select the most important task for the current work session\n2. **Remove distractions**: Close unnecessary tabs, silence notifications, clear your workspace\n3. **Set a time boundary**: Use time-boxing or the Pomodoro Technique (25-minute focused sessions)\n4. **Complete or pause deliberately**: Finish the task or reach a logical stopping point before switching\n5. **Take intentional breaks**: Rest between tasks to maintain cognitive freshness\n\n**Psychological benefits:**\n\n- Reduces anxiety from juggling multiple commitments\n- Creates a sense of accomplishment with each completed task\n- Builds focus as a trainable skill over time\n- Promotes presence and mindfulness in work\n\nIn a world that glorifies busyness, single-tasking is a counter-cultural practice that prioritizes effectiveness over the illusion of productivity.",
