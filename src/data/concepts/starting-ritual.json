    "summary": "A consistent routine that signals the transition into focused work mode.",
    "explanation": "A starting ritual is a consistent sequence of actions that signals your brain it's time to begin focused work. The ritual creates a transition from distraction to concentration, building an association between the routine and productive work. Examples include: making a specific tea, reviewing goals for the session, putting on particular music, setting a timer, or arranging the workspace. Starting rituals work because: consistency builds automatic associations, the ritual provides a buffer from prior context, and completing the ritual creates psychological permission to begin. Key principles: keep it short (1-5 minutes), be consistent (same elements each time), and protect it from variation. Starting rituals are particularly valuable for: work requiring creative focus, environments with many distractions, and people who struggle with task initiation. For knowledge workers, developing a starting ritual means: creating a reliable on-ramp to deep work that doesn't depend on feeling motivated or inspired.",
