    "summary": "The ability to do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not.",
    "explanation": "Self-discipline is the ability to control one's feelings and overcome weaknesses. It's doing what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not. Self-discipline requires self-control and is built through consistency. Discipline comes through self-control - managing impulses, delaying gratification, and following through on commitments. A disciplined mind brings happiness because it reduces internal conflict and builds self-trust. Discipline equals freedom: by constraining certain behaviors, you liberate yourself to achieve what matters most.",
