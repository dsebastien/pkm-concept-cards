    "explanation": "Clarity in writing is the quality that makes meaning immediately understandable to readers - they grasp what you mean without re-reading or guessing. Clear writing respects readers' time and attention. Elements of clarity: precise word choice (saying exactly what you mean), logical structure (ideas in sensible order), explicit connections (transitions showing relationships), and appropriate complexity (neither oversimplified nor unnecessarily complex). Clarity principles: one idea per sentence, concrete over abstract, active voice (usually), short words over long (when meaning is same), and front-load key information. Clarity enemies: jargon (when not needed), vague words (stuff, things, aspects), passive voice (when it hides responsibility), and complex structures (when simple works). Testing clarity: read aloud (hear confusion), have others read (do they understand?), return after time (fresh eyes catch issues), and check assumptions (is context needed?). Clarity vs sophistication: clear writing can be sophisticated - complexity should serve meaning, not obscure it. Simple doesn't mean simplistic. For knowledge workers, clarity is essential: unclear writing wastes readers' time, obscures good ideas, and undermines credibility. Clear communication is professional communication.",
