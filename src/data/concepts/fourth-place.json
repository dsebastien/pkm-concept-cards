    "summary": "A thinking space beyond home, work, and social environments.",
    "explanation": "The Fourth Place concept extends Ray Oldenburg's 'Third Place' theory. While home is the first place, work the second, and social gathering spots the third, the fourth place is a dedicated thinking space. In the knowledge economy, this is often a personal knowledge system like Obsidian - a command center for thought where you can think deeply without the distractions of other environments. Your PKM system becomes your fourth place: a sanctuary for focused intellectual work.",
