    "summary": "A mental model that approaches problems backward by thinking about what could cause failure.",
    "explanation": "Inversion is a powerful mental model championed by Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's long-time partner. Instead of asking 'How do I succeed?', you ask 'What would guarantee failure?' and then avoid those things. The approach has roots in the mathematician Carl Jacobi's motto 'Invert, always invert.' For example, instead of asking 'How do I build a great team?', ask 'What would destroy team morale?' (micromanagement, unclear goals, lack of recognition) and avoid those behaviors. Inversion helps uncover hidden obstacles, identify risks early, and challenge assumptions you might otherwise miss. It's particularly useful when direct approaches seem blocked or when you need to stress-test a strategy. Combined with forward thinking, inversion provides a more complete picture of any decision or problem.",
