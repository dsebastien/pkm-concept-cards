    "summary": "Different systematic approaches to grouping similar tasks together for improved efficiency and focus.",
    "explanation": "Batching Strategies are various approaches to grouping similar tasks to minimize context switching and maximize focus. Common strategies include: Time-based batching (dedicating specific time blocks to task types, like emails only at 9am and 4pm), Theme-based batching (assigning themes to days, such as 'Meeting Mondays' or 'Writing Wednesdays'), Energy-based batching (matching demanding tasks to high-energy periods and routine tasks to low-energy times), Tool-based batching (completing all tasks requiring the same tool together), and Communication batching (grouping all calls, messages, and emails into designated windows). Advanced strategies include: 'Minimum viable batches' (smallest effective grouping size), 'Batch scheduling' (planning batch sessions in advance), and 'Batch triggers' (environmental cues that signal batch-mode activation). The key is matching the batching strategy to your work type, energy patterns, and constraints. Hybrid approaches often work best - for example, combining theme days with time-blocked communication batches. Effective batching requires experimentation to find what works for your specific workflow and discipline to maintain the batches against interruption pressure.",
