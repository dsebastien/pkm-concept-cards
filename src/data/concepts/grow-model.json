    "summary": "A structured coaching framework using Goal, Reality, Options, and Will stages.",
    "explanation": "The GROW Model is one of the most widely used coaching frameworks, developed in the UK during the late 1980s. It provides a simple yet powerful structure for coaching conversations, helping coachees discover their own solutions rather than being told what to do.\n\nThe four stages:\n\nG - Goal\n- What do you want to achieve?\n- What would success look like?\n- How will you know when you've achieved it?\n- Is this goal SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)?\n\nR - Reality\n- What is the current situation?\n- What have you tried so far?\n- What obstacles are you facing?\n- What resources do you have?\n- On a scale of 1-10, where are you now?\n\nO - Options\n- What could you do?\n- What else? (keep asking)\n- What would you do if there were no constraints?\n- What have you seen others do?\n- What are the pros and cons of each option?\n\nW - Will (or Way Forward)\n- What will you do?\n- When will you do it?\n- What support do you need?\n- How committed are you (1-10)?\n- What might get in the way, and how will you handle it?\n\nKey coaching principles:\n\n1. Ask, don't tell - Questions unlock thinking\n2. Trust the coachee - They have the answers\n3. Stay curious - Avoid judgment\n4. Listen deeply - What's not being said?\n5. Silence is powerful - Let them think\n\nGROW is effective because:\n\n- Creates clarity through structured exploration\n- Builds ownership - coachee generates solutions\n- Develops capability - teaches problem-solving\n- Works across contexts - career, performance, personal\n\nGROW can be used in formal coaching sessions, one-on-ones, or even brief hallway conversations. The key is genuinely helping someone think through a challenge rather than solving it for them.",
