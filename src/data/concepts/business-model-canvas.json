It consists of nine building blocks: Customer Segments, Value Propositions, Channels, Customer Relationships, Revenue Streams, Key Resources, Key Activities, Key Partnerships, and Cost Structure. The canvas is useful for mapping existing business models, designing new ones, and managing a portfolio of business models. It provides a shared language for describing, visualizing, assessing, and changing business models.",
