    "summary": "A mental framework that perceives time as perpetually insufficient, driving rushed behavior.",
    "explanation": "Time scarcity mindset is a psychological orientation that perceives time as chronically insufficient, regardless of actual availability. This mindset creates: rushed behavior, difficulty being present, anxiety about wasted time, and paradoxically, wasted time through poor decisions. Sendhil Mullainathan's scarcity research shows that feeling time-poor tunnels attention on immediate demands while neglecting important but non-urgent matters - the same way financial scarcity affects decision-making. The mindset becomes self-reinforcing: feeling time-poor leads to rushing, which leads to mistakes and rework, which creates actual time shortage, confirming the scarcity belief. Breaking the cycle requires: recognizing time scarcity as partly mindset, not just circumstance, creating slack for the unexpected, and practicing presence over perpetual planning. For knowledge workers, addressing time scarcity mindset means: examining beliefs about time, building buffers, and recognizing when rushing is habitual rather than necessary.",
