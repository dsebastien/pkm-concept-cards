    "summary": "The concept that creators can sustain themselves with a small number of highly engaged supporters.",
    "explanation": "Kevin Kelly's '1000 True Fans' argues that creators don't need millions of followers—they need a relatively small number of true fans who will buy everything they produce. A 'true fan' purchases whatever you create, travels to see you, tells others about you. If 1000 true fans each spend $100/year, that's $100,000 in revenue. The math adapts: 500 fans at $200, or 100 at $1000. This reframes creator economics—instead of optimizing for mass appeal (and mass commodification), focus on deepening connection with a smaller audience. Success requires: direct relationships (not platform-dependent), multiple offerings to purchase, and genuine value that earns devotion. The concept has enabled countless independent creators to build sustainable businesses.",
