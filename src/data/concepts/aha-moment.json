    "summary": "The sudden moment of insight when understanding or a solution clicks into place.",
    "explanation": "An Aha moment is the experience of going from 'I don't get it!' to 'Aha, now I get it!' It's when we finally understand something or find the solution to a problem we've been struggling with - an epiphany, a moment of insight. Aha moments are unpredictable; sometimes we struggle for days before the solution appears 'all of a sudden' in our minds. Also known as the Eureka effect, these moments often come after periods of incubation when we step away from a problem. In PKM, creating conditions for aha moments involves connecting diverse ideas and allowing time for unconscious processing.",
