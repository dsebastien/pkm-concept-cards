    "summary": "A measure of the gain or loss generated relative to the amount invested.",
    "explanation": "Return on Investment (ROI) measures the efficiency of an investment by comparing the gain relative to its cost. Calculated as (Gain - Cost) / Cost, it helps evaluate whether investments of time, money, or effort are worthwhile. In PKM and learning, consider ROI of time spent: Does reading this book justify the hours invested? Does maintaining this system pay off in productivity? Not everything can be quantified, but ROI thinking helps prioritize high-leverage activities.",
