    "summary": "The activity level of the vagus nerve - a key indicator of stress resilience and emotional regulation capacity.",
    "explanation": "Vagal tone refers to the activity level of the vagus nerve, the primary nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system that connects the brain to major organs including heart, lungs, and gut. High vagal tone indicates strong vagus nerve activity and is associated with: better emotional regulation, faster stress recovery, improved social engagement, and greater resilience. Low vagal tone is associated with: inflammation, depression, anxiety, and difficulty calming down after stress. Vagal tone is often measured through heart rate variability (higher HRV suggests higher vagal tone). It can be improved through: slow diaphragmatic breathing (especially extended exhales), cold exposure, exercise, social connection, singing or chanting, and mindfulness practices. For knowledge workers, building vagal tone is like training a 'physiological off switch' for stress.",
