    "explanation": "Rate of Revelation is a content creation concept referring to the pace at which you reveal new information to your audience. This pace should be as high as possible - it's what keeps readers interested and engaged. Pack a ton of information in each paragraph or minute of content. Avoid filler, padding, and slow build-ups. Every sentence should deliver value or advance the narrative. A high rate of revelation respects your audience's time and keeps them hooked, reducing drop-off and increasing the chance they'll consume your content to the end.",
