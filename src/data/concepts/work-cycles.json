    "explanation": "Work cycles are structured periods alternating focused work with breaks, designed for sustainable productivity. The Pomodoro Technique (25 min work, 5 min break) is well-known, but many variations exist: 52/17 (based on DeskTime research), 90-minute ultradian cycles, custom durations matching personal rhythms. Cycles work by: preventing overexertion, creating natural stopping points, leveraging time pressure, and providing regular recovery. Effective cycles include: clear work/break distinction (no half-working), complete disengagement during breaks, and appropriate duration for the work type. Some work (deep creative work) may benefit from longer cycles; some (administrative processing) from shorter ones. Finding optimal cycle length requires experimentation. For knowledge workers, implementing work cycles means: starting with established frameworks, adjusting based on experience, and using cycles to impose rhythm on otherwise amorphous knowledge work.",
