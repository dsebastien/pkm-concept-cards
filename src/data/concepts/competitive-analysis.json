    "summary": "Systematic evaluation of competitors to understand their strategies, strengths, weaknesses, and market position.",
    "explanation": "Competitive analysis examines who you're competing with and how to differentiate. Key areas to analyze: product features and pricing, target market and positioning, marketing strategies and channels, strengths and weaknesses, customer reviews and complaints, and market share trends. Tools include SWOT analysis, Porter's Five Forces, and perceptual mapping. The goal isn't copying competitors but understanding the landscape to find opportunities and threats. Competitive intelligence is ongoing—markets evolve constantly. For creators and knowledge workers, competitive analysis might reveal underserved audiences, content gaps, pricing opportunities, or differentiation angles. The danger is over-focusing on competitors rather than customers.",
