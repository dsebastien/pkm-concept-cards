    "summary": "A core set of essential productivity practices that form the foundation of an effective productivity system.",
    "explanation": "The Minimum Viable Productivity Toolkit represents the essential practices needed for effective personal productivity. Rather than adopting every productivity technique available, focus on these core elements: Journaling through daily notes for reflection and planning; GTD principles including clear short, medium, and long-term goals and Inbox Zero; Prioritization using the Eisenhower Matrix; Focus on the Most Important Task of the Day; Making time for priorities; Periodic reviews for continuous improvement; Mindfulness practice; and Healthy routines covering sleep, rest, hydration, and exercise. This minimalist approach prevents overwhelm while ensuring the fundamentals are covered.",
