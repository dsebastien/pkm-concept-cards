    "explanation": "Rest is not just about sleep. There are seven types of rest we all need for complete recovery: Physical rest (more sleep, naps, deep breaths, relaxation, stretching), Mental rest (music, meditation, silence), Emotional rest (offloading emotional baggage, talking to a good listener, therapy), Social rest (catching up with an old friend, or taking a break from socializing), Creative rest (reading a book, taking a walk in nature), Spiritual rest (doing things that give you a sense of purpose or meaning), and Sensory rest (turning off devices and screens, finding the quiet). Understanding which type of rest you need helps you recover more effectively.",
