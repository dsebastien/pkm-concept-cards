    "summary": "The ability to manage and respond to emotional experiences in adaptive, healthy ways.",
    "explanation": "Emotional regulation refers to the processes by which we influence which emotions we have, when we have them, and how we experience and express them. It's not about suppressing emotions but about responding to them skillfully. Key strategies include: situation selection (avoiding triggers), attention deployment (redirecting focus), cognitive reappraisal (reframing situations), and response modulation (managing expression). The prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in regulating the amygdala's emotional responses. Poor emotional regulation is linked to anxiety, depression, and relationship problems. Effective regulation involves: recognizing emotions early, creating space between stimulus and response, having multiple coping strategies, and practicing regularly. Mindfulness, journaling, and therapy can all improve emotional regulation skills. For knowledge workers, emotional regulation enables staying productive despite setbacks and maintaining relationships under pressure.",
