  "summary": "Using a stable object like the breath to steady and ground a wandering mind.",
  "explanation": "Anchor attention is the practice of using a stable, always-available object - most commonly the breath - to ground attention when the mind wanders. Like a ship's anchor prevents drifting, an attention anchor provides a home base to return to when thoughts carry you away. The breath is the most popular anchor because: it's always present, it connects mind and body, it responds to emotional states, and focusing on it activates the parasympathetic nervous system. Other anchors include: body sensations, sounds, mantras, or visual objects. The practice isn't about never leaving the anchor but about noticing when you've drifted and gently returning. Over time, this builds: the ability to notice distraction quickly, the skill of redirecting attention, and a stable presence that can weather mental storms. For knowledge workers, anchor attention is the foundation for sustained focus.",
