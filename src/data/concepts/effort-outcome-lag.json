    "summary": "The inevitable delay between putting in effort and seeing visible results.",
    "explanation": "Effort-Outcome Lag refers to the important delay between the moment when you create something or invest effort and the moment when the effects become truly obvious. This gap can be disorienting because we expect immediate feedback from our actions, but meaningful results often take time to materialize. The lag exists because flywheels need time to build momentum and compound growth effects require sustained effort before becoming tangible. Understanding this concept helps maintain motivation during the waiting period - delayed gratification is clearly at play here. Knowing that the lag is normal prevents discouragement and helps you stay consistent with your efforts even when results aren't immediately visible. Whether building a business, creating content, or developing a knowledge management system, recognizing this temporal gap helps you persist through the initial period when your work seems to produce no results.",
