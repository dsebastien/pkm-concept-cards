    "summary": "The art and science of adult learning - how adults learn differently from children.",
    "explanation": "Andragogy, developed by Malcolm Knowles, describes how adult learning differs from child learning (pedagogy). Key assumptions about adult learners: they are self-directed and want control over their learning; they bring rich experience that becomes a learning resource; they are most interested in learning that has immediate relevance to their work or life; learning is problem-centered rather than content-centered; they are primarily internally motivated. Implications for teaching adults include: involving them in planning and evaluation, drawing on their experience, focusing on real-world application, using collaborative methods, and explaining why things need to be learned. For knowledge workers, understanding andragogy helps design effective training, seek appropriate learning experiences, and leverage unique adult learning advantages. Adults don't learn worse than children - they learn differently, and adult learning design should honor this.",
