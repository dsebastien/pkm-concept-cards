    "summary": "The principle that increasing the efficiency of resource use tends to increase total consumption rather than decrease it.",
    "explanation": "Jevons Paradox, named after economist William Stanley Jevons who observed it in 1865, describes a counterintuitive phenomenon: when we become more efficient at using a resource, we often end up consuming more of it, not less.\n\nJevons' original observation concerned coal: as steam engines became more fuel-efficient, coal consumption increased rather than decreased. The efficiency gains made coal-powered activities more economical, leading to wider adoption and ultimately higher total consumption.\n\nHow the paradox works:\n1. **Efficiency improves**: Technology makes resource use more productive\n2. **Cost decreases**: Using the resource becomes cheaper per unit of output\n3. **Demand increases**: Lower costs drive increased usage\n4. **Total consumption rises**: Increased demand outweighs efficiency gains\n\nModern examples:\n- More fuel-efficient cars lead to more driving\n- Faster internet leads to larger file downloads and streaming\n- Energy-efficient appliances coincide with more appliances per household\n- **AI efficiency**: As AI tools become more efficient, we use them for more tasks\n\nImplications for knowledge work and AI:\n- Productivity tools may lead to more work, not more leisure\n- AI efficiency gains could increase overall AI usage dramatically\n- Time saved by automation often gets filled with new tasks\n- Efficiency alone doesn't guarantee reduced resource consumption\n\nThe paradox suggests that efficiency improvements must be paired with intentional constraints or behavioral changes to achieve genuine reduction in resource use.",
