  "summary": "A structured approach to intentional growth and skill development over time.",
  "explanation": "A Personal Development Plan (PDP) is a structured document outlining your growth goals, the skills and knowledge you want to develop, and the actions you'll take to achieve them. Unlike vague intentions, a PDP makes development concrete and trackable. Key components include: self-assessment (current skills, strengths, gaps), goal setting (what you want to achieve/become), action plans (specific steps, resources, timelines), and review mechanisms (how you'll track progress). Effective PDPs are: specific enough to be actionable, realistic yet stretching, aligned with values and long-term vision, regularly reviewed and updated, and balanced across life domains. They're commonly used in: career development, academic settings, coaching relationships, and personal annual planning. For knowledge workers, a PDP helps ensure continuous growth rather than letting skills stagnate, and provides direction for learning investments.",
