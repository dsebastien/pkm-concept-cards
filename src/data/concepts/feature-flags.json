    "explanation": "Feature Flags (also called feature toggles or feature switches) are a technique that allows teams to modify system behavior without deploying new code. Features are wrapped in conditional logic controlled by configuration. Types of feature flags include: (1) Release toggles - control when features go live, (2) Experiment toggles - enable A/B testing, (3) Ops toggles - control operational aspects like circuit breakers, (4) Permission toggles - enable features for specific users. Benefits include: separating deployment from release, enabling trunk-based development, supporting canary releases, and allowing quick rollbacks. Best practices: keep flags short-lived, clean up old flags, document flag purposes, and use a feature flag management system. Common tools include LaunchDarkly, Split.io, and Unleash. Feature flags are fundamental to modern continuous delivery practices.",
