    "summary": "Begin taking action now rather than waiting for perfect conditions that may never arrive.",
    "explanation": "Start Before You Are Ready is a principle that encourages immediate action rather than waiting for the 'perfect' moment. The core ideas are: do not wait for the perfect opportunity to come by, as you might keep waiting for your entire life; start now and work your way towards making things perfect. Waiting for ideal conditions is often a form of procrastination or perfectionism in disguise. The reality is that we learn and improve through doing, not through endless preparation. By starting before we feel fully ready, we gain real experience, receive feedback, and make actual progress toward our goals.",
