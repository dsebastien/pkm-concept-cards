    "summary": "The ability to shift between activation and calm states, maintaining balance in the autonomic nervous system.",
    "explanation": "Nervous system regulation refers to our capacity to manage the autonomic nervous system's balance between the sympathetic (fight/flight/freeze) and parasympathetic (rest/digest) branches. A well-regulated nervous system can respond to stress appropriately and return to calm efficiently. Dysregulation—from trauma, chronic stress, or poor lifestyle habits—manifests as being stuck in hyperarousal (anxiety, tension, hypervigilance) or hypoarousal (numbness, disconnection, fatigue). Regulation skills include: breathing techniques (especially slow exhales which activate the vagus nerve), grounding exercises (engaging senses), physical movement, social co-regulation (calm presence of others), and practices like meditation. Understanding that many emotional difficulties are nervous system states rather than character flaws can reduce shame and point toward body-based interventions alongside cognitive approaches.",
