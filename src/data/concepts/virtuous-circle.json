    "summary": "A positive feedback loop where success reinforces behaviors that lead to more success.",
    "explanation": "A Virtuous Circle is a positive feedback loop where favorable conditions reinforce behaviors that create more favorable conditions. In PKM: taking good notes improves thinking, better thinking produces better notes, which compounds over time. Unlike a vicious circle (negative feedback), virtuous circles build momentum toward positive outcomes. Designing your PKM system to create virtuous circles - where each action naturally leads to the next beneficial action - is key to sustainable practice.",
