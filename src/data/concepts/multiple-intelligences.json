    "summary": "Howard Gardner's theory that intelligence comprises multiple distinct types rather than a single ability.",
    "explanation": "The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, developed by Howard Gardner in 1983, proposes that human intelligence is not a single general ability but comprises multiple distinct types. Rather than asking 'How smart are you?', this theory asks 'How are you smart?' The eight intelligences are: Linguistic (word smart), Logical-Mathematical (number smart), Spatial (picture smart), Musical (music smart), Bodily-Kinesthetic (body smart), Interpersonal (people smart), Intrapersonal (self smart), and Naturalistic (nature smart). Each can be developed through practice and education. This framework helps in understanding diverse learning styles and cognitive strengths.",
