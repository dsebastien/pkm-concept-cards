    "summary": "A systematic approach to identifying and automating repetitive tasks and workflows to increase efficiency and reduce manual effort.",
    "explanation": "Automating processes is a strategic approach to improving efficiency by eliminating repetitive manual work. The process follows three key steps:\n\n1. **Standardize the process**: Before automation, ensure the process is consistent and well-defined. Document each step clearly so there's no ambiguity about what needs to happen.\n\n2. **Simplify it as much as possible**: Remove unnecessary steps, eliminate redundancies, and streamline the workflow. The simpler the process, the easier it is to automate and maintain.\n\n3. **Identify which steps can be automated**: Not every step needs or benefits from automation. Focus on repetitive, time-consuming tasks that don't require human judgment or creativity.\n\nAutomation can take many forms: scripts, macros, no-code tools, templates, or dedicated software. The goal is to free up mental energy and time for higher-value work that requires human insight and creativity. Start small with low-risk automations, then gradually expand as you build confidence and expertise.",
