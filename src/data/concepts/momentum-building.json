    "summary": "Creating forward motion through small wins that generate energy for larger efforts.",
    "explanation": "Momentum building is the practice of generating psychological forward motion through accumulated small wins, making larger efforts feel more achievable. Physics provides the metaphor: objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Applied to work: completing small tasks creates energy and confidence for tackling bigger ones. Momentum building strategies include: starting with easiest related task, using 'quick wins' to generate energy, maintaining daily minimums to prevent restart friction, and celebrating small progress. The opposite - losing momentum - makes restarting disproportionately difficult. Momentum is especially important because: motivation often follows action (not vice versa), consistency compounds, and productive periods tend to cluster. For knowledge workers, momentum building helps: overcome inertia on difficult projects, maintain progress during low-motivation periods, and create productive rhythms that self-sustain. The key is: don't break the chain - small daily progress maintains momentum better than occasional large efforts.",
