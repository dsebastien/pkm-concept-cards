    "explanation": "A post-focus review is a brief practice after focused work sessions to capture progress, note insights, and prepare for the next session. Elements include: documenting what was accomplished, noting where you stopped (leaving breadcrumbs for restart), capturing any ideas or next steps, and reflecting on what worked or didn't. The review serves multiple purposes: closure on the session, momentum preservation (easier restart with clear notes), and learning (improving future focus sessions). Without review, progress is less concrete, restart is harder, and insights fade. Effective reviews are: brief (5 minutes or less), structured (same elements each time), and actionable (producing useful notes). The Hemingway technique (stopping mid-sentence to ease restart) can be combined with review. For knowledge workers, implementing post-focus review means: building a simple review habit, keeping consistent notes, and treating the review as part of the focused work, not an optional add-on.",
