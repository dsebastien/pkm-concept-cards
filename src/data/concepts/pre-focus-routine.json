    "explanation": "A pre-focus routine is a consistent sequence of actions performed before focused work sessions to prepare both mind and environment. Unlike spontaneous starting, the routine creates reliable conditions for focus. Elements might include: reviewing session goals, closing unnecessary applications, clearing physical workspace, brief mindfulness practice, and preparing needed materials. Routines work because: they reduce decision load (no wondering how to start), they create transition space (moving from distraction to focus), and they build association (routine = focus time). Effective pre-focus routines are: short enough to not become procrastination, consistent enough to build habit, and comprehensive enough to address common obstacles. The routine differs from rituals in emphasis - routines focus on practical preparation while rituals include psychological signaling. For knowledge workers, developing a pre-focus routine means: identifying what preparation actually helps, making it consistent, and using the routine as an on-ramp rather than a delay.",
