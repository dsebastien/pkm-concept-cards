    "summary": "Short-term stress response to immediate challenges or threats that resolves when the situation passes.",
    "explanation": "Acute stress is the immediate, short-term stress response to a specific challenge or threat. It's the body's evolved mechanism for handling danger: heart rate increases, stress hormones release, senses sharpen, and energy mobilizes for action. Once the challenge passes, the body returns to baseline. This is stress working as designed - adaptive, time-limited, and followed by recovery. Examples include: public speaking, near-miss accidents, deadline pressure, or difficult conversations. Acute stress can even be performance-enhancing (eustress) when perceived as challenge rather than threat. The key distinction from chronic stress is resolution and recovery - acute stress has a clear end point and the body restores homeostasis. Problems occur when acute stressors pile up without recovery, or when the acute response is disproportionate to actual threat (anxiety disorders).",
