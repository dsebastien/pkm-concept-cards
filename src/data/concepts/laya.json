    "summary": "A meditative state of mental absorption, dissolution, or deep relaxation where thoughts temporarily cease.",
    "explanation": "Laya (Sanskrit: लय) refers to a state of mental absorption, dissolution, or deep meditative trance in Hindu and Buddhist meditation practices. The term literally means \"dissolution\" or \"absorption\" and describes a condition where the ordinary thinking mind temporarily dissolves into a state of deep stillness.\n\nIn laya, the practitioner experiences:\n- Temporary cessation of discursive thought\n- Deep mental and physical relaxation\n- A sense of merging or dissolving boundaries\n- Blank or void-like mental state\n- Pleasant calmness and peace\n\nWhile laya can be deeply restful and pleasant, traditional meditation teachers often distinguish it from true meditative insight (vipassana) or concentration (samadhi). Laya is sometimes considered a subtle obstacle because:\n- It can be mistaken for genuine spiritual attainment\n- Practitioners may become attached to the pleasant feelings\n- It represents a temporary suppression rather than transformation of mental patterns\n- It can lead to dullness or sleepiness if not balanced with clear awareness\n\nThe concept is important for meditators to understand the difference between genuine insight and mere mental quieting. While laya has value as a restorative state, teachers emphasize that true meditation involves maintaining clear, alert awareness rather than dissolving into blankness.\n\nIn yoga, laya yoga specifically focuses on absorption practices, using concentration techniques to achieve states of mental dissolution as a pathway to higher consciousness.",
