    "summary": "Your greatest work - a masterpiece that distills all of your effort into one truly exceptional creation.",
    "explanation": "Magnum opus is Latin for 'Great Work.' It refers to a masterpiece - something that distills all of your effort, skill, and experience into one truly great thing. Something scarce, rare, and hard to forget.\n\nSteve Jobs called these 'dents in the universe' - contributions that change things for everyone who comes after.\n\n**Characteristics of a magnum opus:**\n\n- **Synthesis of everything you've learned**: It represents the culmination of your skills, knowledge, and experience.\n\n- **Uniquely yours**: No one else could have created it in quite the same way.\n\n- **Lasting impact**: It endures and continues to matter long after completion.\n\n- **Deep personal meaning**: It represents what you truly care about.\n\n**The pursuit of magnum opus:**\n\nSome people work toward a single magnum opus their entire lives. Others create multiple significant works across different domains. There's no single right approach.\n\nWhat matters is:\n- Having something you're building toward\n- Doing work that could become your greatest contribution\n- Not settling for work that doesn't matter to you\n\nYour magnum opus might be a book, a company, a body of research, an artistic creation, a family, or a life well-lived. The form matters less than the intention to create something meaningful.",
