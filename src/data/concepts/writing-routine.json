    "summary": "Consistent habits and practices that support regular, productive writing.",
    "explanation": "A writing routine is a consistent set of habits and practices that support regular, productive writing. Rather than waiting for inspiration, routines make writing a reliable part of life. Components of a writing routine: time (when you write), place (where you write), duration (how long), triggers (what initiates writing), and rituals (actions that signal writing time). Why routines work: reduce decision fatigue (no daily 'should I write?' debate), build momentum (consistency creates habit), train your brain (routine signals 'writing mode'), and accumulate output (small daily amounts compound). Building a routine: start small (even 15 minutes), be consistent (same time, same place), protect the time (treat it as non-negotiable), and adjust based on results. Common patterns: morning pages (first thing), fixed daily time, session-based (pomodoros), and project-based (intensive sprints). What to include: warm-up activities, writing itself, and review/planning. Sustainable routines: fit your life, don't rely on motivation, and survive disruption (easy to restart). For knowledge workers, a writing routine transforms writing from sporadic struggle to consistent output - the key to building a body of work over time.",
