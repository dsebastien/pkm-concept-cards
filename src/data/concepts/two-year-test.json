    "summary": "Teach what you would have found valuable two years ago.",
    "explanation": "The Two-Year Test is a framework from Ship 30 for 30 that guides what content to create and teach. It has two complementary parts: First, teach what you would have found valuable two years ago - you have knowledge and experience that past-you desperately needed. Second, document what you're learning now to become the person you will be in two years. This creates a virtuous cycle where you help others while solidifying your own learning. It removes the impostor syndrome of 'who am I to teach?' by recognizing you don't need to be an expert - you just need to be a few steps ahead of your audience.",
