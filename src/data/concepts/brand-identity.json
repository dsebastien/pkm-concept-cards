    "explanation": "Brand identity is how you present your brand to the world—the tangible elements that create recognition and communicate who you are. Components include: visual identity (logo, colors, typography, imagery), verbal identity (name, tagline, voice, messaging), and experiential identity (how interactions feel). Strong brand identity is distinctive (stands out), consistent (recognizable across touchpoints), authentic (reflects true values), and memorable (sticks in minds). Identity should derive from strategy—what you want to be known for—rather than aesthetic preference alone. For creators, brand identity includes your visual style, writing voice, content formats, and the feeling people get from your work. Consistency builds recognition; distinctiveness builds memorability.",
