    "summary": "Managing a diverse collection of projects, skills, or investments for balanced growth and risk.",
    "explanation": "Portfolio Thinking applies investment principles to careers, projects, and skills. Instead of betting everything on one path, you maintain a portfolio: some safe, established work; some experimental projects; some skill-building activities. This balances stability with growth potential and reduces risk. For knowledge workers, a portfolio might include core work, side projects, learning investments, and creative experiments. The portfolio evolves over time as experiments succeed or fail.",
