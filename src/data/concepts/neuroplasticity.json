    "summary": "The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.",
    "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is the brain's remarkable ability to change and adapt by forming new neural pathways and reorganizing existing ones. This process occurs in response to learning, experience, and recovery from injury. The brain is not fixed after childhood but continues to reshape itself throughout life. Neuroplasticity underlies our ability to learn new skills, form new habits, and recover from trauma. It works through mechanisms like synaptic strengthening (when connections are frequently used) and synaptic pruning (when unused connections are eliminated). Understanding neuroplasticity empowers us to intentionally shape our brains through deliberate practice, learning, and mindset shifts. It provides scientific backing for concepts like growth mindset and explains why consistent practice leads to expertise.",
