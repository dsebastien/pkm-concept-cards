    "explanation": "The Socratic Method is a form of cooperative dialogue and critical inquiry based on asking and answering questions to stimulate thinking and illuminate ideas. Named after the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, who used questioning to expose contradictions in his interlocutors' beliefs, the method helps participants discover truth through their own reasoning rather than receiving it passively. Key techniques include asking open-ended questions, probing assumptions, requesting evidence, exploring implications, and examining the question itself. In knowledge management, the Socratic method can be applied to one's own notes - questioning assertions, examining assumptions, and pushing ideas to their logical conclusions. It cultivates intellectual humility and the recognition that wisdom begins with acknowledging what we don't know.",
