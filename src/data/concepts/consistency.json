    "explanation": "Consistency is showing up regularly and maintaining steady effort over time. It's the foundation of progress - small actions repeated consistently compound into significant results. Consistency builds momentum, creates habits, and leads to self-discipline. In PKM, consistency means regular capture, processing, and review of notes. It means maintaining your system even when motivation wanes. Productivity is not so much about throughput, but rather about consistency. Consistent execution is powerful because it builds trust with yourself and others, creates predictability, and enables sustainable progress.",
