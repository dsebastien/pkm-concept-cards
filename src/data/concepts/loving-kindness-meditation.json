    "explanation": "Loving-kindness meditation (metta bhavana) is a Buddhist practice for cultivating unconditional goodwill toward yourself and all beings. The traditional format involves silently repeating phrases like 'May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be safe, may I live with ease' - first directed at yourself, then progressively to: a benefactor, a friend, a neutral person, a difficult person, and finally all beings everywhere. The practice trains the mind to default toward warmth rather than criticism or indifference. Research shows loving-kindness meditation increases positive emotions, social connection, and self-compassion while reducing depression, anxiety, and self-criticism. For knowledge workers prone to harsh self-judgment, it's particularly valuable. Even a few minutes of practice can shift emotional state. The key is genuine intention, not forced emotion.",
