    "summary": "A brain network active during rest and mind-wandering, associated with self-reflection and creativity.",
    "explanation": "The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a large-scale brain network that becomes active when we're not focused on external tasks—during rest, daydreaming, mind-wandering, and self-reflection. It's involved in autobiographical memory, envisioning the future, understanding others' perspectives, and creative thinking. The DMN works in opposition to the task-positive network (active during focused work). While excessive DMN activity is linked to rumination and depression, healthy DMN function is essential for creativity, insight, and making connections between ideas. This explains why breakthrough ideas often come during showers or walks. Balancing focused work with deliberate rest periods allows the DMN to process information and generate insights, making rest an active part of creative and knowledge work.",
