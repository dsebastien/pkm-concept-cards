    "summary": "Applying knowledge from one domain to accelerate learning in another.",
    "explanation": "Transfer Learning is the ability to apply knowledge, skills, and patterns from one domain to accelerate learning in another. When diving into a new field or topic, recognizing familiar patterns helps learn faster. A programmer learning a new language leverages existing programming concepts; a musician learning a new instrument applies music theory. Building a rich knowledge base enables more transfer learning opportunities. Connected notes make cross-domain patterns more visible.",
