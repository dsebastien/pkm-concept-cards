    "explanation": "Emotional burnout is a nervous system breakdown caused by the accumulation of emotional stress over time. Unlike general burnout, it's not necessarily linked to work, though work can be a root cause. Symptoms include continuous stress, sleep troubles, stomach aches, feeling hopeless with no ideas or options left, mental load, irritability, unstable mindset, and uncontrolled obsessive thoughts. Causes include putting too much pressure on ourselves, others demanding too much from us, and exhausting our resources. Recovery requires recharging through more sleep, regular sleep cycles, time off, proper hydration, avoiding junk food, personal time, delegating tasks, letting go of perfectionism, and challenging false beliefs.",
