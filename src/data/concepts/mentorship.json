    "summary": "A developmental relationship where an experienced person guides another's growth and career.",
    "explanation": "Mentorship is a relationship in which a more experienced or knowledgeable person (mentor) guides a less experienced person (mentee) in their professional and personal development. Effective mentorship provides: career guidance, psychosocial support, skill development, network access, and wisdom from experience. Unlike coaching (which focuses on specific skills or goals), mentorship is typically broader and longer-term. Good mentors: share experiences honestly including failures, ask questions rather than just advising, make connections and open doors, provide safe space for discussing challenges, and adapt to mentee needs. Good mentees: come prepared with specific questions, are open to feedback, take action on advice, respect mentor's time, and keep mentors updated on progress. For knowledge workers, mentorship accelerates learning by: providing shortcuts from others' experience, offering perspective on career decisions, and expanding professional networks.",
