    "summary": "High-confidence errors are more likely to be corrected when you receive feedback than low-confidence errors.",
    "explanation": "The hypercorrection effect is a counterintuitive memory phenomenon where errors made with high confidence are more likely to be corrected and remembered correctly after feedback than errors made with low confidence. You might expect confident errors to be more resistant to change, but the opposite is true. The surprise of being wrong about something you were sure of appears to create a stronger memory update. This effect has been reliably demonstrated across ages and domains. Implications for learners: don't avoid testing yourself on things you're unsure about - even high-confidence errors benefit from correction. Getting things wrong confidently and receiving immediate feedback is actually a powerful learning mechanism. This supports the value of frequent low-stakes testing, even (especially) on material you think you know well.",
