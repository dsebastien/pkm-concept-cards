    "summary": "A systematic process of tracking and analyzing how you spend your time to identify patterns, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.",
    "explanation": "A Time Audit is a deliberate exercise of tracking every activity throughout your day to understand exactly where your time goes. Like a financial audit reveals spending patterns, a time audit exposes how you actually use your hours versus how you think you use them.\n\n**Why conduct a time audit**:\n- Reveals hidden time sinks and distractions\n- Exposes gaps between intentions and reality\n- Identifies peak productivity periods\n- Highlights opportunities for delegation or elimination\n- Creates baseline data for improvement\n\n**How to conduct a time audit**:\n\n1. **Choose a tracking method**:\n   - Paper log with 15-30 minute intervals\n   - Time tracking apps (Toggl, RescueTime, Clockify)\n   - Calendar retrospective at day's end\n\n2. **Track for sufficient duration**: Minimum 3 days, ideally 1-2 weeks to capture variations\n\n3. **Capture everything**: Include work tasks, breaks, meals, commuting, social media, and transitions\n\n4. **Be honest**: Record what actually happened, not what you planned\n\n5. **Categorize activities**:\n   - Deep work vs. shallow work\n   - Proactive vs. reactive tasks\n   - Value-adding vs. wasteful activities\n   - Energizing vs. draining work\n\n**Analyzing your audit**:\n- Calculate percentages for each category\n- Identify your biggest time consumers\n- Find patterns in productive vs. unproductive periods\n- Notice context-switching frequency\n- Spot 'time traps' that consistently derail your plans\n\n**Taking action**:\n- Eliminate or reduce low-value activities\n- Protect time for high-impact work\n- Align tasks with energy levels\n- Set boundaries around common interruptions\n- Revisit the audit quarterly to measure improvement",
