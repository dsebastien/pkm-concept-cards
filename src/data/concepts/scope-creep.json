    "summary": "The gradual expansion of project boundaries beyond original definitions.",
    "explanation": "Scope creep is the gradual expansion of a project's scope beyond its original definitions, often occurring incrementally through small changes that seem reasonable individually but cumulatively transform the project. Characteristics include: changes happen gradually (no single decision to expand), each addition seems small ('just one more thing'), and the cumulative effect is large (project becomes unrecognizable). Causes include: unclear initial scope, stakeholder additions, gold-plating (adding unrequested features), and poor change management. Consequences include: missed deadlines, budget overruns, quality degradation, and project failure. Preventing scope creep requires: clear initial scope definition, change management processes, ability to say no, and regular scope reviews. Some expansion may be appropriate (scope evolution) but should be: conscious, evaluated against tradeoffs, and formally accepted. For knowledge workers, managing scope creep means: defining boundaries clearly, recognizing when scope is shifting, pushing back on additions that compromise core goals, and distinguishing essential evolution from problematic expansion.",
