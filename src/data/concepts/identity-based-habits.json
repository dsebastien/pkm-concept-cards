    "summary": "Changing behavior by focusing on who you want to become, not what you want to achieve.",
    "explanation": "Identity-based habits, popularized by James Clear in Atomic Habits, shift the focus from outcome-based goals to identity change. Instead of 'I want to write a book' (outcome), you think 'I am a writer' (identity). This approach works because we naturally act in alignment with our self-image. Every action becomes a vote for the type of person you want to become. When your identity shifts, habits become expressions of who you are rather than obligations to fulfill. The process: decide who you want to be, prove it to yourself with small wins, and let evidence accumulate. For example, someone building a reading habit doesn't just read - they become 'a reader.' This makes the behavior more sustainable because you're not fighting against your identity but expressing it.",
