    "summary": "Success is not a one-time event but a process that comes from relentlessly showing up every day, even when you don't feel like it.",
    "explanation": "Eventual success is the understanding that success is not a single moment or breakthrough - it's a process requiring continuous effort and dedication. The key insight: eventual success can only come from relentlessly showing up.\n\n**What relentlessly showing up means:**\n\n- Coming back day after day, regardless of motivation\n- Putting in the work even when you don't feel like it\n- Maintaining consistency through ups and downs\n- Not waiting for inspiration to act\n\n**Why this perspective matters:**\n\n1. **Sets realistic expectations**: Success rarely happens quickly. Understanding it's eventual prevents premature discouragement.\n\n2. **Emphasizes process**: Focusing on showing up (which you can control) rather than outcomes (which you often can't).\n\n3. **Builds identity**: When you show up consistently, you become the kind of person who shows up. This identity then drives future behavior.\n\n4. **Compounds over time**: Each day of showing up builds on previous days. Small efforts accumulate into significant results.\n\n**The temporal aspect:**\n\nThe word 'eventual' is important. It acknowledges that:\n- Success takes time\n- The timeline is uncertain\n- What matters is continuing until it happens\n\nYou don't know which day will be the breakthrough - but you guarantee it won't happen if you stop showing up.",
