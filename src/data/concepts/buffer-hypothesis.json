    "summary": "The theory that social support protects against the harmful effects of stress.",
    "explanation": "The buffer hypothesis proposes that social support acts as a protective buffer against the negative effects of stress on health and wellbeing. According to this model, stress is particularly harmful when people lack social resources; with adequate social support, the same stressors produce less damage. The buffering can work through multiple mechanisms: practical help reduces stressor impact, emotional support aids coping, and feeling connected may directly affect physiological stress responses. Research supports the buffer hypothesis, showing that socially connected individuals experience less illness, faster recovery, and better mental health outcomes when facing stress. For knowledge workers, this suggests that investing in relationships isn't optional - it's a health and performance strategy. Building and maintaining social connections is preventive medicine against stress-related harm.",
