    "name": "Sunday Reset",
    "summary": "A weekly preparation and planning ritual performed at the end of the week to set yourself up for success in the coming week.",
    "explanation": "The Sunday Reset is a structured weekly ritual designed to close out one week and prepare for the next. It combines elements of review, planning, and self-care to create a sense of closure and readiness.\n\n**Core components of a Sunday Reset:**\n\n1. **Weekly Review**: Reflect on the past week - what went well, what didn't, and what you learned. Review your calendar, notes, and completed tasks.\n\n2. **Planning Ahead**: Look at the upcoming week, identify key priorities, schedule important tasks, and set intentions. This leverages the principle that making plans before the week starts preserves decision-making energy.\n\n3. **Physical Reset**: Organize your physical environment - clean your workspace, do laundry, prepare meals, lay out clothes. A tidy environment reduces cognitive load.\n\n4. **Digital Reset**: Clear inboxes, process notes, organize files, and update task lists. Close open loops that might cause mental clutter.\n\n5. **Self-Care**: Include restful or rejuvenating activities - exercise, reading, time with family, or simply relaxing.\n\n**Why Sunday specifically:**\n\nSunday works well because it provides a buffer between the work week's end and the new week's start. You can reflect with fresh perspective while still having time to prepare. However, the specific day matters less than consistency - some prefer Friday afternoon or Monday morning.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Reduces Monday anxiety and decision fatigue\n- Creates psychological closure for the past week\n- Builds momentum before the week begins\n- Ensures priorities are clear before getting caught in reactive mode\n- Combines practical preparation with mental readiness\n\nThe Sunday Reset transforms the transition between weeks from a source of stress into an opportunity for intentional preparation.",
