The method is both a structure (composed of an Inbox, Literature notes archive, and Permanent notes archive) and a process for capturing, exploring, storing, and organizing ideas. It puts focus on connecting ideas rather than accumulating isolated pieces of information, helping to build a deep Web of Knowledge that aids in research, writing, and idea development.",

While each note can only be stored in a single folder, many MoCs can link to the same note, making MoCs like 'folders on steroids.' If links are roads, tags are road signs, folders are houses, then MoCs are maps. They help locate content across the knowledge base, aggregate and connect ideas, keep the knowledge base manageable as it scales, and add context to links. You can even create a 'MoC of MoCs' to express ideas at the intersection of multiple topics.",

Flow occurs when challenge level matches skill level. Tips to get more often in the zone include: eliminating distractions, setting clear goals, getting immediate feedback, and working on appropriately challenging tasks.",

Unlike time blocking (which reserves time), timeboxing limits time. This creates urgency, prevents perfectionism, and ensures important tasks don't consume unlimited time. When the timebox ends, you move on - even if unfinished. Timeboxing is particularly useful for open-ended tasks that could expand indefinitely.",
